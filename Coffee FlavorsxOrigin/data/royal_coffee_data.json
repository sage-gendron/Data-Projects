        "background": "\n\t\t\tCoffee Background\n\t\t\tCooperativa Agr\u00edcola Cafetalera San Juan (San Juan) was formed in 1974 with 40 farmer members across Caranav\u00ed united in the goal of supporting small family farms and organic, chemical-free methods. The cooperative started out strong; by the mid-2000s Bolivia was hosting annual Cup of Excellence competitions and there was a high level of international development interest in the Yungas coffee sector, of which Caranav\u00ed is the center. However, productivity declined tremendously from 2006-2017 among cooperative members due to aging trees and falling investment. That year, Felix Chambi Garcia joined the organization, bringing with him over 16 years of specialty experience as a cupper and member of various other Bolivian cooperatives. Since then, the coop\u2019s total production, overall quality, and diversity of coffees has all increased significantly. Felix sees himself as part of the younger, renewed generation of coffee lovers in Bolivia\u2014including baristas and roasters\u2014who are fortunate to be in a producing country with such high potential. This generation certainly believes there is a lot of ground to be covered.\n\nSan Juan relies on individual farmers to process their own coffee. Felix has made quality control central to the coop\u2019s operations, and his lab in Alto Cochabamba serves as the central control point for all lot building and exportation. Parchment lots that don\u2019t make the minimum requirement are sold domestically, rather than marketed abroad. Harvesting goes according to a common protocol as well: coffee cherry is picked exclusively ripe, floated to sort by density, depulped on small mechanical depulpers, and fermented 18-24 hours. Once fermentation is complete the parchment is washed clean in narrow basins and sundried on raised screen beds. The cooperative is working toward installing mechanical demucilagers to better calibrate the pulping and fermentation of the various members.\n\nBolivia is South America's only landlocked coffee producing country and is the smallest exporter of coffee on the continent. The quality of that coffee, however, is hardly lacking in diversity or beauty. Bolivia\u2019s terrain and geography is gifted for arabica production, particularly throughout its greater Yungas region (Yungas is Aymara for \"warm lands\"), whose mountain ranges connect the low and humid Amazonian basin to the dry Andean altiplano above.\n\nThe most productive municipality in the Yungas is by far Caranav\u00ed, where 85-90% of Bolivia's specialty coffee has continued to thrive over the decades. Caranav\u00ed's landscape is steep, cloudy, rugged, and remote, with natural forest making up more than 90% of the territory. Coffee farms in this high and tropical climate tend to be well-managed but small, challenged by isolation and lacking in long-term industry support. Bolivian growers still often don\u2019t have processing equipment or transportation of their own, a massive hurdle in such territory.\n\nBiodiversity, soil health, elevation, and progressive leadership in San Juan all work undeniably in favor of small farmers seeking sustainable livelihoods with coffee. Yet, facing each and every Bolivian coffee, especially the best ones, is one of the most strenuous overland transits in the coffee world, passing elevations of 4000 meters over the top of the Andes and west to the port of Arica on Chile\u2019s coast. The country\u2019s low production, select few producer groups in the specialty game, and formidable logistical challenges, means each successful arrival is something to be cherished.\t\t",

For the first time in the country\u2019s history, green coffee production has funding and support from the federal government, fueling the search for knowledge among dedicated young coffee professionals. The epicenter in the rise of Bolivian specialty coffee is in the Yungas region, where most farms were first established after a wave of migration to the region caused by Bolivia\u2019s Agrarian Revolution in the 1950s. And nearly a century later this lot emerges from the Mamani family farm as the benchmark for the region\u2019s profile. The 27-acre farm called El Mirador is located near Caranav\u00ed. The Mamani family has been growing coffee in the greater Yungas region of Bolivia for over 50 years. During the harvest, cherries are carefully selected, depulps, fermented in sealed tanks, washed and then the parchment is dried on patios and raised beds. Since Bolivia is a landlocked coffee producing country, farmers need extra help getting their coffee to the international market. AGRICAFE deserves a lot of credit for their dedication to delivering Bolivia's coffee potential to the international market. AGRICAFE was established in 1986 and is a family business that manages 12 of its own farms and also supports other small farms across Caranav\u00ed and Nor Yungas. Their smallholder program, \u201cSol de Ma\u00f1ana\u201d, began in 2013 with 10 producers and a curriculum focused on nursery and farm management, and specialty harvesting. Organic fertilizers were made available to participants at half price and each individual coffee tree was tracked for pruning, inputs, productivity and picking. This granular attention to detail has improved productivity and quality and carries over to the logistics of moving coffee to the dry-mill where quality and traceability are protected during the preparation for export.\t\t",

        "background": "\n\t\t\tCoffee Background\n\t\t\tThe Mogiana region of Brazil is a small designation of coffee origin along the border between S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais states. The region has a long history of agriculture, mining and in more recently, cash-cropping. Waves of European settlers aggressively transformed large portions of Brazil\u2019s inland savannah over many generations of colonial development, beginning with sugar cane and then quickly favoring coffee as consumption grew across the global north. S\u00e3o Paulo state includes some of Brazil\u2019s oldest coffee history, with one of the country\u2019s first rail-to-port transportation pipelines serving the state\u2019s main coffee port of Santos\u2014whose title would be the namesake grade of commercial coffee from Brazil for many years. Once a slave plantation economy, Brazil\u2019s coffee production underwent cycles of booms and busts with a bad reputation for quality among consumers during its industrialization period. In the past 30 years, however, Brazil has made clear to the global coffee industry that its history has led to what is now easily the planet's most modern coffee farming culture, with world-class agronomic research and post-harvest technology that accommodates huge scale, as well as exemplary farmworker labor protections and high minimum wages for pickers.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDespite the default impression of Brazil as being dominated by large, mechanized farms, still about half of the country\u2019s coffee farmers are small, family-managed operations who process at home and sell to local growers\u2019 organizations to earn their living. Smaller farms tend to be clustered in the more difficult landscapes for coffee efficiency\u2014the ones that are steep and forested, difficult to access, or at higher elevations where the climate is more challenging for coffee to thrive.\u00a0\n\nFAF Coffees is a specialty exporter in Brazil founded by the Croce family. During their years spent struggling to revive the soils of their own family farm in the Mogiana region, the Croces connected with like-minded growers struggling as well to make farming viable for the next generation, with a strong focus on their immediate ecosystems\u2014the watersheds and canopies that made the land worth living on\u2014as well as quality, as means to economic independence and self-esteem. Over the years the Croce\u2019s network of farmers grew. FAF now exports coffee on behalf of 150 small and sustainable farms throughout the Mogiana region, and increasingly, other pockets of entrepreneurial small growers dedicated to the same combination of cup quality, environmental health, and community strength, exuberantly referred to in the FAF network as \u201ctotal quality\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThis particular lot is a micro-blend of 2 farms located in the community of Cerra do Cigano, or \u201cGypsy Hill\u201d, in the municipality of Caconde, a rolling, mountainous area with steep slopes and abundant natural springs, populated mostly by legacy family homesteads. S\u00edtio Boa Vista is one of the very first farms to join the Croce family in their mission to transform their land, when very few buyers in the world expected specialty coffee from Brazil. The farm is 17 hectares and entirely hand-harvested. It is managed by Gertrudes and her husband Celso, and their son Denner, and includes extended family members to manage the harvest. The second farm, S\u00edtio Joaninha, is run by Valdir Jos\u00e9 Ferreira, whose grandparents first moved to Caconde 35 years ago. After spending holidays on the farm and learning the lifestyle, he moved to the region himself and established Joaninha, a 7-hectare estate, which is now home to Valdir, his wife Daniela, their two children, and Valdir\u2019s parents, all of whom help run the farm. \u201cJoaninha\u201d translates to \u201cladybug\u201d, named after his mother\u2019s experience of watching agro-chemicals destroy the once thriving ladybug population on the farms, killing off the land\u2019s natural pest control\u2014the family\u2019s mission is to farm regeneratively and bring the ladybugs back. Both farms utilize raised beds for drying naturals, which are constantly rotated and sorted by the families during the drying.\u00a0\n\nBoa Vista and Joaninha have become evangelists within FAF\u2019s network and synonymous with the effort to revive small coffee farms and create a new market for the \u201cother\u201d Brazil: the harder-to-access family plots with high quality potential and an embodiment of community ideals deserving of visibility among specialty roasters.\u00a0\t\t",

Raised in Bujumbura, Jeanine would go on to earn an MBA from Northwestern University\u2019s prestigious Kellogg School, cycle through corporate America, and eventually reconnect with her birth country by founding Burundi Friends International, a not-for-profit that funds educational and economic empowerment programs for rural Burundians, which is now in its 13th year. After a few years marketing Burundi coffees stateside for friends and family, Jeanine realized she had every reason to lead the business, and JNP Coffees was born.\nJNP Coffee is highly focused on women\u2019s empowerment, and along with a few local women\u2019s rights advocates, formulated the Burundi chapter of the International Women\u2019s Coffee Alliance. The network of IWCA farmer members in Burundi is now more than 2,000, whose coffee is differentiated by membership, marketed for its traceability and impact, and which generates end-of-year premiums for all involved. In fact, the IWCA value chain has been so impactful that JNP has created additional programs to expand their farmer base and generate premiums beyond the IWCA registered growers.\nThis is one of those additional programs. A local leader of a producer group in Karuzi Province decided to seek JNP\u2019s partnership. Karuzi is located in central Burundi and historically lesser known for its coffee compared to neighboring Ngozi and Kayanza provinces, considered to be Burundi\u2019s top quality producers. The Karuzi group had heard of JNP\u2019s assistance programs and post-harvest premiums and wanted to know how to get involved. Due to exactly this type of demand, JNP has established the \u201cDushime\u201d program (dushime in Kirundi translates to \u201clet\u2019s be thankful\u201d), which provides quality consulting, lot selection, marketing to JNP\u2019s buyer community, and end-of-year premiums for participating groups not otherwise members of the IWCA. This coffee, created from only one distinct processing lot from this harvest, has been titled Ubuto, which translates to \u201cyoung\u201d. The name is a reflection of the brand-new partnership between JNP and Karuzi Province, as well as the literal age of the coffee trees themselves, which among this group are only a few harvests old, and distinctly youthful in the cup: this microlot is toasty sweet and fruited, like graham crackers and jam, with an acidic clarity and delicate floral layer that indicates many years of bright, assertive coffee ahead.\nFully washed processing by the Ubuto group is as detailed as anywhere in Burundi where the best coffees are produced. Cherry is floated for density and visible defects prior to depulping and fermentation. After fermentation is complete the wet parchment is sorted by density in concrete washing channels. Drying takes place at first under shade, and then in open air with the parchment piled into pyramids, which are flattened and re-shaped each day as a form of incremental air exposure to slowly and evenly dry the coffee and lock in the final moisture.\t\t",

Colombia exports the second highest volume of arabica coffee on earth after Brazil, and it\u2019s not controversial to observe that the qualities exported are categorically higher and more diverse than almost any country of comparison. Colombia\u2019s 12 million bag export average is achieved by over half a million farms averaging about 1.5 hectares apiece, which is a staggering level of small-farm excellence across the board. After almost 45 years of cupping and buying as much Colombia coffee as we can take, we are still amazed annually and what can be found.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe goal of the FNC\u2019s regional competitions is to facilitate this discovery for buyers. Like micro-Cup of Excellence contests, entries from throughout a single department are screened by Federaci\u00f3n cuppers and then the top-scoring finalists are presented to a select global audience with full traceability and an open-pricing auction platform. Often the FNC interviews the producers live online while the auction is underway, letting them show their farms and tell their stories to the global audience.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCielo Ruy Bolivar Gonzalez\u2019 coffee was one of Royal\u2019s purchases at this year\u2019s auction. Cielo, along with her husband and 3 children, manage 3 hectares of coffee near Caicedo. Cielo is 35 years old, practically a child compared to the global average age of small coffee farmers (which is still in the 60s), but has almost 20 years of experience picking and processing coffee. She and her family purchased the land for El Naranjo 8 years ago and began production with 300 coffee trees. Little by little the family transformed the 3-hectare property to a high-production farm flush with 4-5 year old healthy coffee trees, which she is constantly renovating parcel by parcel. Cielo had never entered a quality competition before but was convinced to enter this one after a local buyer insisted she do so. She has always been happy living and working in the field, but now feels she can also be proud of what she produces, having been recognized in this way through the competition.\u00a0\n\nProcessing at El Naranjo is carried out entirely by Cielo and her family, with the help of only 1 or 2 neighbors. Cherry is hand picked at peak ripeness and then left to ferment as whole fruit for a period of 24 hours. Once this first fermentation step is complete the cherry is depulped and fermented again for 2 days, washed, and taken to the family\u2019s covered dryers to dry.\u00a0\n\nCielo and her family of 5 are members of the local Cooperativa de Caficultores de Salgar, which maintains a collection point in Caicedo, and which extends a lot of necessary services to their members to support their development. The cooperative also sponsors individual growers\u2019 participation in department-wide or national competitions like Best of Antioquia.\u00a0\t\t",

        "background": "\n\t\t\tCoffee Background\n\t\t\tHuila is arguably Colombia\u2019s best-known department for bright and aromatic coffees, light on the palate and articulate in flavor. Huila is a long and narrow valley that follows a winding gap between two large cords of the Andes. Uphill from the valley\u2019s lush and picturesque lower slopes (Colombia\u2019s 950-mile long Magdalena River has its source in southern Huila and has shaped the agriculture here for centuries) are a diverse array of coffee producing communities, often dramatically steep, and each with their own unique climate and history. Algeciras is one such community, located near the middle of the department and tucked away in its Eastern foothills near the border of Caquet\u00e1.\nThe 5-hectare farm of La Floresta, belonging to 73 year-old Nohora Sepulveda de Zambrano, is a 45-minute drive from the municipality of Algeciras. Do\u00f1a Nohora runs the farm with a small team, consisting of Alexander, her longtime farm manager, her two sons Edwin and Rafael, and an annual team of 25 local pickers to execute each of the farm\u2019s two harvests (Huila, like some other departments in Colombia\u2019s coffee belt, has both an early summer main crop and what\u2019s known as a mitaca, or fly crop, that occurs in the fall). Do\u00f1a Nohora\u2019s farm is part of a larger family parcel that includes adjacent land formerly owned by her late husband, now managed by Edwin and his wife, Nancy Maria. The extended family grows plantains and yucca alongside their coffee, which includes Castillo, Caturra, and Colombia cultivars.\nProcessing at La Floresta is a multi-week endeavor, due to the climate effect on fermentation and drying. Coffee, carefully hand-picked in the field, is depulped and fermented up to 60 hours, washed clean, and then dried for up to 45 days on raised beds, which the family keeps inside a parabolic greenhouse. The family also maintains patios for additional drying space.\nAzahar Coffee, the sourcing company and exporter of Do\u00f1a Nohora\u2019s coffee, originally began as a specialty roaster and coffee boutique in Bogot\u00e1 serving Colombia\u2019s top quality microlots to a developing local consumer base. In time, Azahar began making international connections to their farmer contacts and exporting green coffee, with top traceability and ambitious price transparency, to select buyers in a few northern markets.\nThe business has evolved to what is now a very sophisticated exporting model. Azahar partners with local grower organizations to identify coffees and producers of the highest potential, pull these aside from the usual export stream, and market them directly to buyers internationally on a quality-based pricing scale. The net effect of the intervention is often significantly more money than a farm could receive without the added exposure and marketing. Through Azahar, countless farms and communities are being uncovered and sold globally with traceability not experienced before. And prices follow: the average farm gate price farmers receive from Azahar sales is 25-50% above Colombia\u2019s federal price. This particular lot was purchased at a farm gate price of COP 1,200,000 per carga (125kg of parchment coffee), or $1.44 per pound for milled green coffee.\t\t",

        "background": "\n\t\t\tCoffee Background\n\t\t\tFor such a naturally gifted department as Quind\u00edo, it tends to receive less recognition than others for its coffee. Quind\u00edo is Colombia\u2019s second-smallest department by size, making up only about 0.2% of the national territory. It\u2019s location, however, right on the central cordillera of Colombia\u2019s vast Andes divide, and centrally between the country\u2019s largest and most influential cities (Bogot\u00e1, Medell\u00edn, and Cali), give it a high volume of tourist traffic, coffee industry, airline commuters, and idyllic getaways in the form of brightly painted mountain towns, natural reserves, and high elevation tropical landscapes throughout. Almost the entire department is mountainous, its lowest elevations still over 1000 meters, and many parts are dense with coffee plantations, from the small to the large and ambitious.\u00a0\n\nFinca Campo Hermoso is a 15-hectare farm outside of Circasia, only a few kilometers north of Quind\u00edo\u2019s capital city Armenia. It\u2019s owner, Edwin Nore\u00f1a, is an agroindustrial engineer by trade with graduate-level studies in biotechnology. Edwin is a well-connected and highly aspirational coffee producer who focuses on cultivating very specific varieties paired with very specific processing methods designed to express the most surprising, memorable, and delicious coffees possible within his resources. Finca Campo Hermoso concentrates on growing a wide variety of coffee cultivars, including pink bourbon, yellow bourbon, yellow caturra, bourbon sidra, gesha, and Cenicafe 1, a resistant hybrid developed by Cenicaf\u00e9, Colombia\u2019s national coffee research institute. The resulting coffees are often marketed under \u201cEl Alquimista\u201d, Edwin\u2019s personal brand for his microlots, which have featured in barista competitions and choosy roasters around the world (and Royal Coffee\u2019s own inventory from time to time).\u00a0\n\nEdwin\u2019s processing for this particular lot involves a two-step fermentation, followed by raised-bed drying. Fresh cherry is first soaked in water for 1 hour, and then fermented in the style of carbonic maceration, in which the fruit is sealed in a chamber with a one-way valve for oxygen to escape but not enter, creating an increasingly CO2-rich environment as the cherry ferments. After 48-hours in the sealed chamber, the cherry is depulped and fermented in a covered tank with the addition of the yellow \u201cmust\u201d\u2014the sugary, tangy juice produced during carbonic maceration\u2014added as well. This second fermentation lasts 72 hours. Once complete the parchment is washed clean, leaving about 25% of the original mucilage intact and taken to raised beds to dry in the sun. Drying takes 15 days for this process. The fully dried coffee is conditioned for 8 days in a warehouse, allowing for humidity to stabilize inside the seeds, and then moved into GrainPro bags for long-term storage, where it is cupped numerous times over the next few weeks for quality analysis.\u00a0\n\nOxygen-deprived, or \u201canaerobic\u201d fermentation environments like the above have gained traction among processing wonks in coffee for the unique flavors and tanginess they can add, as well as creating exaggerated lactic- or phosphoric-like characteristics in the cup compared to what we\u2019re used to. Edwin, by investing in his processing knowhow, is able to produce a wide variety of cup profiles from a small parcel of land, further expanding cuppers\u2019 expectations of Quind\u00edo coffees and evolving the standards of his peers, not to mention boosting the notoriety of Campo Hermoso and the 30 families that contribute work to the farm.\u00a0\u00a0\t\t",

This is certainly the case with this natural processed micro-lot, harvested from Cerro Nuboso, a 4-acre farm owned by Thais Chacon Zuniga. While the farm has been in the Chac\u00f3n family for generations, the newest generation of the Chac\u00f3n family have taken the family farms in a new direction. The biggest change came in 2017 when Thais\u2019 children established a mill to process the harvest and prepare green coffee for export, breaking the traditional mold of delivering cherries to a cooperative mill. With full independence, the Chac\u00f3n family has implemented post-harvest controls that bring out the best in their coffee. These include meticulous attention to cherry selection and extended drying times on raised beds. Coffee is stored to rest for 3 months and then prepared for export with the same care given at the wet-mill. The family has recently refocused on farm renovations that include a more robust shade canopy to mitigate climate change and extend maturation times, which promote sweeter profiles.\t\t",

Carlos and his family are members of Caf\u00e9 de Altura de San Ram\u00f3n Especial S.A. (Caf\u00e9 de Altura), an association that was founded in 2004 and currently has more than 3500 members who receive technical support to increase the quality of their coffee and productivity on their farms. El Diamante is an example of cutting edge experimentation paying off for producers. The coffee is processed using an anaerobic fermentation process, which means the depulped coffee was fermented in an airtight tank with its own honey water. Temperature, brix, pH, time, and pressure are carefully controlled to enhance the coffee's flavors during the fermentation process. The results have been frequently recognized with top finishes in the Cup of Excellence auction in Costa Rica, including a fourth-place finish in 2017.\t\t",

The cherries are quickly weight and placed in a large tank with water to remove the less dense beans that float to the top inside the cherry. Next the cherries are depulped and pass through a demucilager that mechanically strips the mucilage from the beans. All of this is done with a recycling water system. The washed beans move down from the wet-mill through a long elevated conveyor belt into a machine that uses forced air to shed any remaining water. The coffee then passes through a series of dryers to gently reduce the moisture to 11 percent. All of this happens in a matter of just over 72 hours, which seems fast until you stop to consider that not a minute is wasted in the process. After all this, the coffee is rested for a period of at least a month in silos and then milled for export with another equally impressive series of machines dedicated to dehulling and sorting green beans by weight and color.\n\nCoopetarrazu has an equally intricate model of income diversification with a profitable agriculture supply store and grocery store.

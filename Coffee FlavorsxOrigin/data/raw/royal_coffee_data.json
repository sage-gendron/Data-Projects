        "background": "\n\t\t\tCoffee Background\n\t\t\tCooperativa Agr\u00edcola Cafetalera San Juan (San Juan) was formed in 1974 with 40 farmer members across Caranav\u00ed united in the goal of supporting small family farms and organic, chemical-free methods. The cooperative started out strong; by the mid-2000s Bolivia was hosting annual Cup of Excellence competitions and there was a high level of international development interest in the Yungas coffee sector, of which Caranav\u00ed is the center. However, productivity declined tremendously from 2006-2017 among cooperative members due to aging trees and falling investment. That year, Felix Chambi Garcia joined the organization, bringing with him over 16 years of specialty experience as a cupper and member of various other Bolivian cooperatives. Since then, the coop\u2019s total production, overall quality, and diversity of coffees has all increased significantly. Felix sees himself as part of the younger, renewed generation of coffee lovers in Bolivia\u2014including baristas and roasters\u2014who are fortunate to be in a producing country with such high potential. This generation certainly believes there is a lot of ground to be covered.\n\nSan Juan relies on individual farmers to process their own coffee. Felix has made quality control central to the coop\u2019s operations, and his lab in Alto Cochabamba serves as the central control point for all lot building and exportation. Parchment lots that don\u2019t make the minimum requirement are sold domestically, rather than marketed abroad. Harvesting goes according to a common protocol as well: coffee cherry is picked exclusively ripe, floated to sort by density, depulped on small mechanical depulpers, and fermented 18-24 hours. Once fermentation is complete the parchment is washed clean in narrow basins and sundried on raised screen beds. The cooperative is working toward installing mechanical demucilagers to better calibrate the pulping and fermentation of the various members.\n\nBolivia is South America's only landlocked coffee producing country and is the smallest exporter of coffee on the continent. The quality of that coffee, however, is hardly lacking in diversity or beauty. Bolivia\u2019s terrain and geography is gifted for arabica production, particularly throughout its greater Yungas region (Yungas is Aymara for \"warm lands\"), whose mountain ranges connect the low and humid Amazonian basin to the dry Andean altiplano above.\n\nThe most productive municipality in the Yungas is by far Caranav\u00ed, where 85-90% of Bolivia's specialty coffee has continued to thrive over the decades. Caranav\u00ed's landscape is steep, cloudy, rugged, and remote, with natural forest making up more than 90% of the territory. Coffee farms in this high and tropical climate tend to be well-managed but small, challenged by isolation and lacking in long-term industry support. Bolivian growers still often don\u2019t have processing equipment or transportation of their own, a massive hurdle in such territory.\n\nBiodiversity, soil health, elevation, and progressive leadership in San Juan all work undeniably in favor of small farmers seeking sustainable livelihoods with coffee. Yet, facing each and every Bolivian coffee, especially the best ones, is one of the most strenuous overland transits in the coffee world, passing elevations of 4000 meters over the top of the Andes and west to the port of Arica on Chile\u2019s coast. The country\u2019s low production, select few producer groups in the specialty game, and formidable logistical challenges, means each successful arrival is something to be cherished.\t\t",

For the first time in the country\u2019s history, green coffee production has funding and support from the federal government, fueling the search for knowledge among dedicated young coffee professionals. The epicenter in the rise of Bolivian specialty coffee is in the Yungas region, where most farms were first established after a wave of migration to the region caused by Bolivia\u2019s Agrarian Revolution in the 1950s. And nearly a century later this lot emerges from the Mamani family farm as the benchmark for the region\u2019s profile. The 27-acre farm called El Mirador is located near Caranav\u00ed. The Mamani family has been growing coffee in the greater Yungas region of Bolivia for over 50 years. During the harvest, cherries are carefully selected, depulps, fermented in sealed tanks, washed and then the parchment is dried on patios and raised beds. Since Bolivia is a landlocked coffee producing country, farmers need extra help getting their coffee to the international market. AGRICAFE deserves a lot of credit for their dedication to delivering Bolivia's coffee potential to the international market. AGRICAFE was established in 1986 and is a family business that manages 12 of its own farms and also supports other small farms across Caranav\u00ed and Nor Yungas. Their smallholder program, \u201cSol de Ma\u00f1ana\u201d, began in 2013 with 10 producers and a curriculum focused on nursery and farm management, and specialty harvesting. Organic fertilizers were made available to participants at half price and each individual coffee tree was tracked for pruning, inputs, productivity and picking. This granular attention to detail has improved productivity and quality and carries over to the logistics of moving coffee to the dry-mill where quality and traceability are protected during the preparation for export.\t\t",

        "background": "\n\t\t\tCoffee Background\n\t\t\tThe Mogiana region of Brazil is a small designation of coffee origin along the border between S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais states. The region has a long history of agriculture, mining and in more recently, cash-cropping. Waves of European settlers aggressively transformed large portions of Brazil\u2019s inland savannah over many generations of colonial development, beginning with sugar cane and then quickly favoring coffee as consumption grew across the global north. S\u00e3o Paulo state includes some of Brazil\u2019s oldest coffee history, with one of the country\u2019s first rail-to-port transportation pipelines serving the state\u2019s main coffee port of Santos\u2014whose title would be the namesake grade of commercial coffee from Brazil for many years. Once a slave plantation economy, Brazil\u2019s coffee production underwent cycles of booms and busts with a bad reputation for quality among consumers during its industrialization period. In the past 30 years, however, Brazil has made clear to the global coffee industry that its history has led to what is now easily the planet's most modern coffee farming culture, with world-class agronomic research and post-harvest technology that accommodates huge scale, as well as exemplary farmworker labor protections and high minimum wages for pickers.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDespite the default impression of Brazil as being dominated by large, mechanized farms, still about half of the country\u2019s coffee farmers are small, family-managed operations who process at home and sell to local growers\u2019 organizations to earn their living. Smaller farms tend to be clustered in the more difficult landscapes for coffee efficiency\u2014the ones that are steep and forested, difficult to access, or at higher elevations where the climate is more challenging for coffee to thrive.\u00a0\n\nFAF Coffees is a specialty exporter in Brazil founded by the Croce family. During their years spent struggling to revive the soils of their own family farm in the Mogiana region, the Croces connected with like-minded growers struggling as well to make farming viable for the next generation, with a strong focus on their immediate ecosystems\u2014the watersheds and canopies that made the land worth living on\u2014as well as quality, as means to economic independence and self-esteem. Over the years the Croce\u2019s network of farmers grew. FAF now exports coffee on behalf of 150 small and sustainable farms throughout the Mogiana region, and increasingly, other pockets of entrepreneurial small growers dedicated to the same combination of cup quality, environmental health, and community strength, exuberantly referred to in the FAF network as \u201ctotal quality\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThis particular lot is a micro-blend of 2 farms located in the community of Cerra do Cigano, or \u201cGypsy Hill\u201d, in the municipality of Caconde, a rolling, mountainous area with steep slopes and abundant natural springs, populated mostly by legacy family homesteads. S\u00edtio Boa Vista is one of the very first farms to join the Croce family in their mission to transform their land, when very few buyers in the world expected specialty coffee from Brazil. The farm is 17 hectares and entirely hand-harvested. It is managed by Gertrudes and her husband Celso, and their son Denner, and includes extended family members to manage the harvest. The second farm, S\u00edtio Joaninha, is run by Valdir Jos\u00e9 Ferreira, whose grandparents first moved to Caconde 35 years ago. After spending holidays on the farm and learning the lifestyle, he moved to the region himself and established Joaninha, a 7-hectare estate, which is now home to Valdir, his wife Daniela, their two children, and Valdir\u2019s parents, all of whom help run the farm. \u201cJoaninha\u201d translates to \u201cladybug\u201d, named after his mother\u2019s experience of watching agro-chemicals destroy the once thriving ladybug population on the farms, killing off the land\u2019s natural pest control\u2014the family\u2019s mission is to farm regeneratively and bring the ladybugs back. Both farms utilize raised beds for drying naturals, which are constantly rotated and sorted by the families during the drying.\u00a0\n\nBoa Vista and Joaninha have become evangelists within FAF\u2019s network and synonymous with the effort to revive small coffee farms and create a new market for the \u201cother\u201d Brazil: the harder-to-access family plots with high quality potential and an embodiment of community ideals deserving of visibility among specialty roasters.\u00a0\t\t",

Raised in Bujumbura, Jeanine would go on to earn an MBA from Northwestern University\u2019s prestigious Kellogg School, cycle through corporate America, and eventually reconnect with her birth country by founding Burundi Friends International, a not-for-profit that funds educational and economic empowerment programs for rural Burundians, which is now in its 13th year. After a few years marketing Burundi coffees stateside for friends and family, Jeanine realized she had every reason to lead the business, and JNP Coffees was born.\nJNP Coffee is highly focused on women\u2019s empowerment, and along with a few local women\u2019s rights advocates, formulated the Burundi chapter of the International Women\u2019s Coffee Alliance. The network of IWCA farmer members in Burundi is now more than 2,000, whose coffee is differentiated by membership, marketed for its traceability and impact, and which generates end-of-year premiums for all involved. In fact, the IWCA value chain has been so impactful that JNP has created additional programs to expand their farmer base and generate premiums beyond the IWCA registered growers.\nThis is one of those additional programs. A local leader of a producer group in Karuzi Province decided to seek JNP\u2019s partnership. Karuzi is located in central Burundi and historically lesser known for its coffee compared to neighboring Ngozi and Kayanza provinces, considered to be Burundi\u2019s top quality producers. The Karuzi group had heard of JNP\u2019s assistance programs and post-harvest premiums and wanted to know how to get involved. Due to exactly this type of demand, JNP has established the \u201cDushime\u201d program (dushime in Kirundi translates to \u201clet\u2019s be thankful\u201d), which provides quality consulting, lot selection, marketing to JNP\u2019s buyer community, and end-of-year premiums for participating groups not otherwise members of the IWCA. This coffee, created from only one distinct processing lot from this harvest, has been titled Ubuto, which translates to \u201cyoung\u201d. The name is a reflection of the brand-new partnership between JNP and Karuzi Province, as well as the literal age of the coffee trees themselves, which among this group are only a few harvests old, and distinctly youthful in the cup: this microlot is toasty sweet and fruited, like graham crackers and jam, with an acidic clarity and delicate floral layer that indicates many years of bright, assertive coffee ahead.\nFully washed processing by the Ubuto group is as detailed as anywhere in Burundi where the best coffees are produced. Cherry is floated for density and visible defects prior to depulping and fermentation. After fermentation is complete the wet parchment is sorted by density in concrete washing channels. Drying takes place at first under shade, and then in open air with the parchment piled into pyramids, which are flattened and re-shaped each day as a form of incremental air exposure to slowly and evenly dry the coffee and lock in the final moisture.\t\t",

SCFCU is robust; there are 53 member cooperatives in the union and over 80,000 member households throughout the Sidama Zone. Harvest in Sidama occurs slightly earlier than in the more southern zones of Gedeo and Guji, and as a result the fully washed lots from here are usually the year\u2019s very first top quality arrivals from anywhere in Ethiopia.\u00a0\n\nWayicho carries out activities that often go unnoticed but are crucial for small producers, including training producers in best organic practices and investing in basic infrastructure needs like road improvements and establishing local warehouses.\u202fSCFCU focuses on establishing a certification process for local cooperatives, creating micro-credit for producers and investing in social programs on a larger scale.

The formation of cooperative unions in Ethiopia allowed for voting power and higher farm returns from the direct exportation that unions would be capable of.

        "background": "\n\t\t\tCoffee Background\n\t\t\tMount Elgon is a massive peak split nearly in two by the border of Uganda and Kenya. The \u201cmountain\u201d itself, now an extinct shield volcano, is more an enormous expanse of successive plateaus that float dramatically above the surrounding valley floor. It is also home to a dense patchwork of farming communities growing some of the best organic coffee in Africa.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nMountain Harvest is a very young and big-thinking group, first established in 2017. The company is dedicated to long-term economic and environmental sustainability for smallholders on Mt. Elgon. These farmers are Uganda\u2019s highest and most diversified coffee growers with incredible quality potential thanks to the climate, soil fertility, and a longstanding culture of land stewardship, but who historically struggle to meet specialty standards by processing coffee in tiny amounts on homemade equipment.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0In an effort to raise the economic standard in remote coffee-growing Elgon communities, Mountain Harvest began as an impact investing project underwritten by Lutheran World Relief (LWR). It has expanded in just a few years to include farmer education and training, central processing infrastructure, storage facilities throughout the region, detailed quality control, and international marketing. As of this year Mountain Harvest works with 850 individual smallholders across 8 communities on Mt. Elgon, with each farm growing between 600-1,000 coffee trees. And their coffee stands up to the best fully washed Uganda arabicas we typically taste all year.\u00a0\n\nThe vast majority of coffee managed by Mountain Harvest is traditionally processed by farmers at home and delivered as parchment. This coffee, however, is a centrally-processed, fully washed microlot from select communities within Mountain Harvest\u2019s farmer network: fresh picked cherry was transported directly from select farms in sealed drums to an experimental processing site constructed by Mountain Harvest near their headquarters in Mbale, where it was depulped, fermented for 24 hours, and dried in larger, carefully-controlled volume on raised beds, all of which is overseen by Mountain Harvest\u2019s processing manager, Ibra Kiganda. Centralized processing is ubiquitous across East Africa but in Uganda it is still rare, where collecting low-quality, often still humid, parchment from smallholders is the norm. While Mountain Harvest has had great success training their farmer base to home-process to excellent standards, the central-processing microlots are an attempt to elevate cup profiles even more through greater control.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOver the course of a full harvest coffees are built into blended containers, single-community lots, experimental centrally-processed lots like this one, and single-delivery microlots for sale. Mountain Harvest\u2019s minimum pricing is 10-30% above local market prices. Unlike other regional buyers who exclusively process centrally or buy lower grade smallholder parchment, Mountain Harvest invests in farmers\u2019 capacity to produce high-specialty cherry or fully-dried parchment coffee within their own resources, helping them maximize their margin when they sell.\u00a0\t\t",

Colombia exports the second highest volume of arabica coffee on earth after Brazil, and it\u2019s not controversial to observe that the qualities exported are categorically higher and more diverse than almost any country of comparison. Colombia\u2019s 12 million bag export average is achieved by over half a million farms averaging about 1.5 hectares apiece, which is a staggering level of small-farm excellence across the board. After almost 45 years of cupping and buying as much Colombia coffee as we can take, we are still amazed annually and what can be found.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe goal of the FNC\u2019s regional competitions is to facilitate this discovery for buyers. Like micro-Cup of Excellence contests, entries from throughout a single department are screened by Federaci\u00f3n cuppers and then the top-scoring finalists are presented to a select global audience with full traceability and an open-pricing auction platform. Often the FNC interviews the producers live online while the auction is underway, letting them show their farms and tell their stories to the global audience.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCielo Ruy Bolivar Gonzalez\u2019 coffee was one of Royal\u2019s purchases at this year\u2019s auction. Cielo, along with her husband and 3 children, manage 3 hectares of coffee near Caicedo. Cielo is 35 years old, practically a child compared to the global average age of small coffee farmers (which is still in the 60s), but has almost 20 years of experience picking and processing coffee. She and her family purchased the land for El Naranjo 8 years ago and began production with 300 coffee trees. Little by little the family transformed the 3-hectare property to a high-production farm flush with 4-5 year old healthy coffee trees, which she is constantly renovating parcel by parcel. Cielo had never entered a quality competition before but was convinced to enter this one after a local buyer insisted she do so. She has always been happy living and working in the field, but now feels she can also be proud of what she produces, having been recognized in this way through the competition.\u00a0\n\nProcessing at El Naranjo is carried out entirely by Cielo and her family, with the help of only 1 or 2 neighbors. Cherry is hand picked at peak ripeness and then left to ferment as whole fruit for a period of 24 hours. Once this first fermentation step is complete the cherry is depulped and fermented again for 2 days, washed, and taken to the family\u2019s covered dryers to dry.\u00a0\n\nCielo and her family of 5 are members of the local Cooperativa de Caficultores de Salgar, which maintains a collection point in Caicedo, and which extends a lot of necessary services to their members to support their development. The cooperative also sponsors individual growers\u2019 participation in department-wide or national competitions like Best of Antioquia.\u00a0\t\t",

        "background": "\n\t\t\tCoffee Background\n\t\t\tHuila is arguably Colombia\u2019s best-known department for bright and aromatic coffees, light on the palate and articulate in flavor. Huila is a long and narrow valley that follows a winding gap between two large cords of the Andes. Uphill from the valley\u2019s lush and picturesque lower slopes (Colombia\u2019s 950-mile long Magdalena River has its source in southern Huila and has shaped the agriculture here for centuries) are a diverse array of coffee producing communities, often dramatically steep, and each with their own unique climate and history. Algeciras is one such community, located near the middle of the department and tucked away in its Eastern foothills near the border of Caquet\u00e1.\nThe 5-hectare farm of La Floresta, belonging to 73 year-old Nohora Sepulveda de Zambrano, is a 45-minute drive from the municipality of Algeciras. Do\u00f1a Nohora runs the farm with a small team, consisting of Alexander, her longtime farm manager, her two sons Edwin and Rafael, and an annual team of 25 local pickers to execute each of the farm\u2019s two harvests (Huila, like some other departments in Colombia\u2019s coffee belt, has both an early summer main crop and what\u2019s known as a mitaca, or fly crop, that occurs in the fall). Do\u00f1a Nohora\u2019s farm is part of a larger family parcel that includes adjacent land formerly owned by her late husband, now managed by Edwin and his wife, Nancy Maria. The extended family grows plantains and yucca alongside their coffee, which includes Castillo, Caturra, and Colombia cultivars.\nProcessing at La Floresta is a multi-week endeavor, due to the climate effect on fermentation and drying. Coffee, carefully hand-picked in the field, is depulped and fermented up to 60 hours, washed clean, and then dried for up to 45 days on raised beds, which the family keeps inside a parabolic greenhouse. The family also maintains patios for additional drying space.\nAzahar Coffee, the sourcing company and exporter of Do\u00f1a Nohora\u2019s coffee, originally began as a specialty roaster and coffee boutique in Bogot\u00e1 serving Colombia\u2019s top quality microlots to a developing local consumer base. In time, Azahar began making international connections to their farmer contacts and exporting green coffee, with top traceability and ambitious price transparency, to select buyers in a few northern markets.\nThe business has evolved to what is now a very sophisticated exporting model. Azahar partners with local grower organizations to identify coffees and producers of the highest potential, pull these aside from the usual export stream, and market them directly to buyers internationally on a quality-based pricing scale. The net effect of the intervention is often significantly more money than a farm could receive without the added exposure and marketing. Through Azahar, countless farms and communities are being uncovered and sold globally with traceability not experienced before. And prices follow: the average farm gate price farmers receive from Azahar sales is 25-50% above Colombia\u2019s federal price. This particular lot was purchased at a farm gate price of COP 1,200,000 per carga (125kg of parchment coffee), or $1.44 per pound for milled green coffee.\t\t",

The small company manages one single producer association in each department where they work, \u201cEcoterra\u201d in Nari\u00f1o, with 140 producer partners, and \u201cTerra Verde\u201d in Huila, with 120.\nFor Terra Coffee SAS as a whole, quality in coffee is very rationally understood as a direct pathway to well-being for volume-limited, small coffee farming families. Driving their business model is an understanding that quality results from small harvests have direct impacts on not just the farm owner, but the many dependents on each small farm, including young children, older adults, and the women of the household performing essential labor that often goes unpaid. By increasing quality and placing microlots in the market, Terra Coffee SAS plans not only to increase prices to growers and their families, but also increase their sense of pride in the details of their work.\nThe 25 producers contributing to this coffee synchronized on a precise fermentation model which, in the own words of Terra Coffee\u2019s founders, was \u201cdesigned to obtain the best fruit and citric notes of Nari\u00f1o, as well as the characteristic sweetness of the region\u201d and \u201cleave us with a brilliant, juicy acidity\u201d.

Quind\u00edo is Colombia\u2019s second-smallest department by size, making up only about 0.2% of the national territory. It\u2019s location, however, right on the central cordillera of Colombia\u2019s vast Andes divide, and centrally between the country\u2019s largest and most influential cities (Bogot\u00e1, Medell\u00edn, and Cali), give it a high volume of tourist traffic, coffee industry, airline commuters, and idyllic getaways in the form of brightly painted mountain towns, natural reserves, and high elevation tropical landscapes throughout. Almost the entire department is mountainous, its lowest elevations still over 1000 meters, and many parts are dense with coffee plantations, from the small to the large and ambitious.\u00a0\n\nFinca Campo Hermoso is a 15-hectare farm outside of Circasia, only a few kilometers north of Quind\u00edo\u2019s capital city Armenia. It\u2019s owner, Edwin Nore\u00f1a, is an agroindustrial engineer by trade with graduate-level studies in biotechnology. Edwin is a well-connected and highly aspirational coffee producer who focuses on cultivating very specific varieties paired with very specific processing methods designed to express the most surprising, memorable, and delicious coffees possible within his resources. Finca Campo Hermoso concentrates on growing a wide variety of coffee cultivars, including pink bourbon, yellow bourbon, yellow caturra, bourbon sidra, gesha, and Cenicafe 1, a resistant hybrid developed by Cenicaf\u00e9, Colombia\u2019s national coffee research institute. The resulting coffees are often marketed under \u201cEl Alquimista\u201d, Edwin\u2019s personal brand for his microlots, which have featured in barista competitions and choosy roasters around the world (and Royal Coffee\u2019s own inventory from time to time).\u00a0\n\nEdwin\u2019s processing for this particular lot involves a two-step fermentation, followed by raised-bed drying. Fresh cherry is first soaked in water for 1 hour, and then fermented in the style of carbonic maceration, in which the fruit is sealed in a chamber with a one-way valve for oxygen to escape but not enter, creating an increasingly CO2-rich environment as the cherry ferments. After 48-hours in the sealed chamber, the cherry is depulped and fermented in a covered tank with the addition of the yellow \u201cmust\u201d\u2014the sugary, tangy juice produced during carbonic maceration\u2014added as well. This second fermentation lasts 72 hours. Once complete the parchment is washed clean, leaving about 25% of the original mucilage intact and taken to raised beds to dry in the sun. Drying takes 15 days for this process. The fully dried coffee is conditioned for 8 days in a warehouse, allowing for humidity to stabilize inside the seeds, and then moved into GrainPro bags for long-term storage, where it is cupped numerous times over the next few weeks for quality analysis.\u00a0\n\nOxygen-deprived, or \u201canaerobic\u201d fermentation environments like the above have gained traction among processing wonks in coffee for the unique flavors and tanginess they can add, as well as creating exaggerated lactic- or phosphoric-like characteristics in the cup compared to what we\u2019re used to. Edwin, by investing in his processing knowhow, is able to produce a wide variety of cup profiles from a small parcel of land, further expanding cuppers\u2019 expectations of Quind\u00edo coffees and evolving the standards of his peers, not to mention boosting the notoriety of Campo Hermoso and the 30 families that contribute work to the farm.\u00a0\u00a0\t\t",

With more than 4,650 members from Tarrazu, a canton in the province of San Jose, Cooperativa de Caficultores de Tarraz\u00fa RL (Coopetarrazu) is designed to receive cherries from many small farms and consistently process their coffee into a well-balanced regional blend called La Pastora.\n\nLike clockwork, a parade of vehicles of all sizes, from pick-up trucks to dump trucks coming from central receiving stations, arrive in the late afternoon full of cherries that were picked during the day. The cherries are quickly weight and placed in a large tank with water to remove the less dense beans that float to the top inside the cherry. Next the cherries are depulped and pass through a demucilager that mechanically strips the mucilage from the beans. All of this is done with a recycling water system. The washed beans move down from the wet-mill through a long elevated conveyor belt into a machine that uses forced air to shed any remaining water.

        "background": "\n\t\t\tCoffee Background\n\t\t\tJeanine Niyonzima-Aroian, the founder of JNP Coffees, is without a doubt one of the most influential individuals in Burundi coffee today.\u00a0\n\nRaised in the capital city of Bujumbura, Jeanine would go on to earn an MBA from Northwestern University\u2019s prestigious Kellogg School, cycle through corporate America, and eventually reconnect with her birth country by founding Burundi Friends International, a not-for-profit funding educational and economic empowerment programs for rural Burundians, which is now in its 13th year. After a few years marketing Burundi coffees stateside for friends and family, Jeanine realized she had every reason to lead the business, and JNP Coffee was born.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nJNP Coffee is highly focused on women\u2019s empowerment, and along with a few local women\u2019s rights advocates, formulated the Burundi chapter of the International Women\u2019s Coffee Alliance. The IWCA value chain has been so impactful over the years that JNP has created additional programs to expand their farmer base and generate premiums not just for women farmers, but for everyone involved. Producer groups of women and men alike, such as this one, can qualify for JNP\u2019s new \u201cDushimeTM\u201d program, which delivers the same kind of post-harvest premiums as IWCA has since 2013. It seems they can\u2019t expand fast enough. In Kayanza and Ngozi, the two provinces at the heart of the nation\u2019s coffee production, competition for cherry can be fierce, so washing stations may pay well above the country\u2019s minimum price to court premium harvests. JNP coffee goes a step further, returning second payments to farmers and investing in opportunities for education and community building.\u00a0\n\nCoffee grown in Ngozi Province has a special meaning for Jeanine, as that is where her mother grew up. Memories of her mother, leading the family\u2019s coffee harvest to cover school fees, are woven into the name for this coffee. Bahire in Kirundi is a kind of well-wishing given to others that roughly translates to \u201cbe well, successful, prosperous, happy\u201d. Bahire is a micro-community of smallholders selected from within one of JNP\u2019s larger communities, Bavyeyi, thanks to their unique terroir. The producer group works closely with JNP Coffee\u2019s trained Q Graders in Burundi on best quality practices and lot curation.\u00a0\n\nFully washed processing for members of the Bahire group is as detailed as anywhere in Burundi where the best coffees are produced. Cherry is floated for density and visible defects prior to depulping and under-water fermentation. After fermentation is complete the wet parchment is sorted by density in concrete washing channels. Drying takes place at first under shade, and then in open air with the parchment piled into pyramids, which are flattened and re-shaped each day as a form of incremental air exposure to slowly and evenly dry the coffee and lock in the final moisture. The resulting profile is exceedingly clean, bright and delicate.\u00a0\t\t",

        "background": "\n\t\t\tCoffee Background\n\t\t\tFor such a naturally gifted department as Quind\u00edo, it tends to receive less recognition than others for its coffee. Quind\u00edo is Colombia\u2019s second-smallest department by size, making up only about 0.2% of the national territory. It\u2019s location, however, right on the central cordillera of Colombia\u2019s vast Andes divide, and centrally between the country\u2019s largest and most influential cities (Bogot\u00e1, Medell\u00edn, and Cali), give it a high volume of tourist traffic, coffee industry, airline commuters, and idyllic getaways in the form of brightly painted mountain towns, natural reserves, and high elevation tropical landscapes throughout. Almost the entire department is mountainous, its lowest elevations still over 1000 meters, and many parts are dense with coffee plantations, from the small to the large and ambitious.\u00a0\n\nFinca Campo Hermoso is a 15-hectare farm outside of Circasia, only a few kilometers north of Quind\u00edo\u2019s capital city Armenia. It\u2019s owner, Edwin Nore\u00f1a, is an agroindustrial engineer by trade with graduate-level studies in biotechnology. Edwin is a well-connected and highly aspirational coffee producer who focuses on cultivating very specific varieties paired with very specific processing methods designed to express the most surprising, memorable, and delicious coffees possible within his resources. Finca Campo Hermoso concentrates on growing a wide variety of coffee cultivars, including pink bourbon, yellow bourbon, yellow caturra, bourbon sidra, gesha, and Cenicaf\u00e9 1, a resistant hybrid developed by Cenicaf\u00e9, Colombia\u2019s national coffee research institute. The resulting coffees are often marketed under \u201cEl Alquimista\u201d, Edwin\u2019s personal brand for his microlots, which have featured in barista competitions and choosy roasters around the world (and Royal Coffee\u2019s own inventory from time to time).\u00a0\n\nEdwin\u2019s processing for this particular lot involves a two-step fermentation, followed by raised bed drying. Fresh cherry is first soaked in water for 1 hour, and then fermented in the style of carbonic maceration, in which the fruit is sealed in a chamber with a one-way valve for oxygen to escape but not enter, creating an increasingly CO2-rich environment as the cherry ferments. After 96 hours in the sealed chamber, the cherry is removed and fermented a second time in a loosely covered tank for 48 hours. Once the second fermentation is complete, the finished cherry is taken directly to raised beds to dry in the sun. Drying takes about 3 weeks for this process and continues until the dried cherry is measuring between 10.5-11.0% moisture. The fully dried coffee is conditioned for 8 days in a warehouse, allowing for humidity to stabilize inside the seeds, and then moved into GrainPro bags for long-term storage, where it is cupped numerous times over the next few weeks for quality analysis.\u00a0\n\nThe big twist to the processing, however, is not only the numerous fermentation styles. At the start of each cherry fermentation, Edwin mixes in a what he calls a \u201cchili must\u201d, a homemade concentrated extract of chili peppers, in order to manipulate the fermentation and infuse the coffee with an additional kick of flavor. While infused fermentations like this rarely bring forth a direct result, we must admit, the balance to the final cup is admittedly sweet-spicy in an incredibly seductive way. The processing steps produce a viscous and refined tactile with out-of-this-world flavors of Aleppo-style pepper, candied ginger, spiced drinking chocolate, cranberry, and mulled wine.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe decision to use chilis here relates to the cultivar itself: aj\u00ed is a south American word for chili peppers generically and was given to this particular strain of arabica by a Colombia Cup of Excellence farmer from Huila, Jos\u00e9 Salazar, who, during harvest, perceived a spicy pepper-like fragrance coming from the coffee fruit as it was broken off its branches. After earning 6th place in the Cup of Excellence in 2021, an investigation was launched into the genetic origins of the winning plants; it was discovered that they were in fact of an unknown lineage to Colombia; however, they could be genetically linked to certain rare landrace varieties in Ethiopia. It wasn\u2019t, in fact, even a bourbon as far as researchers could tell. So the name stuck and seeds, as it happens, were sought from other growers like Edwin.\u00a0\n\nOxygen-deprived, or \u201canaerobic\u201d fermentation environments like the above have gained traction among processing wonks in coffee for the unique flavors and tanginess they can add, as well as creating exaggerated lactic- or phosphoric-like characteristics in the cup compared to what we\u2019re used to. Edwin, by investing in his processing knowhow, and in this case, a drive for flavor enhancement, is able to produce a wide variety of cup profiles from a small parcel of land, further expanding cuppers\u2019 expectations of Quind\u00edo coffees and evolving the standards of his peers, not to mention boosting the notoriety of Campo Hermoso and the 30 families that contribute work to the farm.\u00a0\u00a0\t\t",

Edwin is a well-connected and highly aspirational coffee producer who focuses on cultivating very specific varieties paired with very specific processing methods designed to express the most surprising, memorable, and delicious coffees possible within his resources. Finca Campo Hermoso concentrates on growing cultivars far apart from the nationally-distributed hybrids, or traditional Caturra: the farm has in production pink bourbon, yellow bourbon, bourbon sidra, gesha, and Cenicafe 1, a resistant hybrid developed by Cenicaf\u00e9, Colombia\u2019s national coffee research institute. The resulting coffees are marketed under \u201cEl Alquimista\u201d, Edwin\u2019s personal brand for his microlots, which have featured in barista competitions and choosy roasters around the world.\u00a0\n\nThe gesha variety needs no introduction in the specialty world, although it\u2019s worth mentioning that despite wide experimentation in Colombia among growers it has yet to achieve the same level of appreciation here than elsewhere, which is surprising given the level of experience throughout Colombia\u2019s coffee sector. It does, however, have its moments.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEdwin\u2019s process for this particular gesha is a combination of steps that he calls \u201cblack honey double carbonic maceration ginger sundried\u201d, which uses a combination of anaerobic cherry fermentation, mucilage fermentation, and a traditional honey process to achieve the final profile. Once picked, the gesha cherries are fermented in a sealed tank deprived of oxygen to allow the fruit to soften and sugars to peak, after which the cherries are depulped and fermented anaerobically a second time with the addition of ginger. After the second, scented fermentation is complete, the coffee is moved to raised screen beds to dry in the sun as a \u201cblack\u201d (high mucilage) honey. The result is an intensely-flavored coffee with dark dried fruit notes as well as anise, florals, and a viscous mouthfeel.\u00a0\n\nOxygen-deprived, or \u201canaerobic\u201d fermentation environments like the above have gained traction among processing wonks in coffee for the unique flavors and tanginess they can add, as well as creating exaggerated characteristics in the cup compared to what we\u2019re used to.

The small company manages one single producer association in each department where they work, \u201cEcoterra\u201d in Nari\u00f1o, with 140 producer partners, and \u201cTerra Verde\u201d in Huila, with 120.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFor Terra Coffee SAS as a whole, quality in coffee is very rationally understood as a direct pathway to well-being for volume-limited, small coffee farming families. Driving their business model is an understanding that quality results from small harvests have direct impacts on not just the farm owner, but the many dependents on each small farm, including young children, older adults, and the women of the household performing essential labor that often goes unpaid. By increasing quality and placing microlots in the market, Terra Coffee SAS plans not only to increase prices to growers and their families, but also increase their sense of pride in the details of their work.\u00a0\n\nThe 12 producers contributing to this coffee synchronized on a precise fermentation model. The model involves two fermentation steps at different phases post-harvest. The first occurs in the whole cherry: fresh-picked fruit is bagged and allowed to ferment for 36-48 hours, for the mucilage fibers to break down and the sugars to peak. The second phase is more traditional but still very specific: the softened cherry is depulped and fermented dry in open tanks for another 30-50 hours. Finally, the fermented parchment is lightly washed and dried in the sun. Each of the 12 producers exhaustively monitored temperature throughout to ensure each batch of coffee was homogenous with the others in order to create a focused, precise final profile.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe cultivar, known as caturra \u201cchiroso\u201d, is likely a kind of misnomer. Originally identified by a farmer in the municipality of Urrao, in the department of Antioquia, the elongated bean and slightly scrappy look of the plant earned the nickname \u201cchiroso\u201d, locally used to mean \u201cstretched out\u201d or \u201ctattered\u201d. Since the new local cultivar started winning regional quality competitions in 2014 the seeds have been transported and planted across other departments. RD2 Vision, a group that provides DNA fingerprinting for coffee genetics, has linked the \u201cchiroso\u201d genotype directly to an Ethiopian landrace, rather than any relative of caturra (itself a natural mutation of bourbon, far evolved from its own landrace origins). So the name appears to be genetically incorrect\u2014nonetheless this is how it is commonly called in Colombia. Some cuppers and Colombian coffee roasters have started referring to the plant as \u201cColombian gesha\u201d, given its direct link to Ethiopian genetics and notable delicacy in the cup that is unique to most of Colombia\u2019s most common cultivars.\u00a0\n\nHuila is arguably Colombia\u2019s best-known department for top microlots. Huila\u2019s geographical accessibility, dense population of knowledgeable farmers, warm and subtropical forests, high elevations, and microclimate diversity have for many years sustained one of specialty coffee\u2019s most beloved regions. Huila is a long and narrow valley that follows a winding gap between two large cords of the Andes. Uphill from the valley\u2019s lush and picturesque lower slopes (Colombia\u2019s 950-mile long Magdalena river has its source in southern Huila and has shaped the agriculture here for centuries) are a diverse array of coffee producing communities, often dramatically steep, and each with their own unique climate and history.\u00a0\u00a0\t\t",

Gedeo is a narrow section of highland plateau dense with savvy farmers and fiercely competitive processors, and has been known commercially as Yirgacheffe for many years after the Yirgacheffe district itself, one of Ethiopia\u2019s first areas to fully wash its coffee. As a coffee terroir, Yirgacheffe has for decades been considered a benchmark for beauty and complexity in arabica coffee\u2014known for being beguilingly ornate and jasmine-like when fully washed, and seductively punchy and sweet when sundried--and hardly requires an introduction.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAdorsi is a very young washing station, having only been first established in 2018. Adorsi is owned and operated by Testi Trading PLC, the same suppliers behind some of our top-scoring Sidama coffees we buy each year from Testi Ayla washing station. Testi Trading has grown a lot in the past few years and are a big part of the growth of independent processors and exporters in Ethiopia\u2019s very competitive south doing the good, laborious work of processing differentiation, traceability, and pushing quality boundaries.\u00a0\n\nAdorsi\u2019s farmer contributors are typical in size for the area, which is to say, tiny: half a hectare of coffee per farmer is the average. Cherry is delivered to the washing station daily throughout the harvest months, where it is depulped and fermented for 36-48 hours depending on the local climate. After fermentation is complete the wet parchment is washed in long channels to scrub off residual mucilage and float off the lowest density coffee. Drying occurs under parabolic shade netting for 5-7 days and rotated consistently until reaching a final resting moisture content of 11-12 percent.\u00a0\n\nPrivate processors like Adorsi are admirable businesses. It\u2019s tough being a private processor in Gedeo, as the sheer density of competition among washing stations tends to push cherry prices as high as double throughout a single harvest, and privates often don\u2019t have the backing of a larger union to secure financing, regulate cherry prices, or bring export costs down with centralized milling and marketing. Successful private washing stations like Adorsi, then, need to be not only standout quality processors to stay afloat; they must also be excellent business developers with connections and community standing, in order to continue winning the business of farmers and buyers alike, and stay afloat for the long term. Testi Trading invests in local education among its communities, including in the Aricha kebele, where it has built 2 primary schools (and has already done similar work in Guji, West Arsi, and Shantawene, Sidama).\u00a0\u00a0\t\t",

        "background": "\n\t\t\tCoffee Background\n\t\t\tMarta Alemu Kanke grows coffee on 2.5 hectares of land in the celebrated Worka region of Ethiopia. Worka is part of Gedeb, one of 8 woredas, or districts, that together comprise the dense and competitive highland zone of Gedeo. (The entire Gedeo zone is often referred to as \u201cYirgacheffe\u201d after another of its districts, Yirga Chefe.)\u00a0\n\nGedeb is a terroir, history, and community all its own that merits unique designation in our eyes. The municipality of Gedeb itself is a is a bustling outpost that links commerce between the Guji and Gedeo Zones. It contains an expansive network of processing stations who buy cherry from across zone borders. Coffee producers here would argue (and we would agree) their coffee profiles are not exactly Yirgacheffe, but something of their own. The communities surrounding Gedeb reach some of the highest growing elevations for coffee in the world and are a truly enchanting part of the long drive into Guji. Coffees from this area, much closer to the Guji Zone than the rest of Yirgacheffe, can be some the more explosive cup profiles we see from anywhere in Ethiopia. Naturals tend to have perfume-like volatiles, and fully washed lots are often sparklingly clean and fruit candy-like in structure.\u00a0\n\n2.5 hectares is considered large for this area, where half a hectare is the norm. The vast majority of coffee processing in Ethiopia is centralized due to complete lack of infrastructure or efficiencies at the farm level, but larger plots like Marta\u2019s allow for greater personal control. Marta grew up assisting her family\u2019s coffee harvest, and now with a 5-member family of her own, she has succeeded in securing an export license, a major feat for a modest size farmer in Ethiopia. Her farm typically hires 50 employees, a lot for a property of this size, to cover all harvesting and processing. Handpicked cherry is all floated for density and then placed directly onto drying beds, where they will be consistently turned and rotated for the few weeks that drying requires. The beds are covered at night, to protect the cherry from settling humidity, as well as for a few hours each afternoon, to prevent scorching from the searingly-hot midday sun.\u00a0\n\nThere are precious few single-farm coffees available from this part of Ethiopia these days. Not long ago there were practically none at all. For the past 10 years, Royal, with support from select cooperatives, led the formation of the Single Farmer Lots Program, in order to break off single farmer lots from the larger cooperative blends sold anonymously through the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange (ECX), taking custody of these precious coffees through a direct sale. The program was a unique micro-channel of almost unprecedented specificity in coffee supply from Ethiopia during those first years. Farmers with the drive and means to sell direct were supported by Royal, and, in turn, our most enthusiastic buyers of Ethiopia coffee had access to a portfolio of single-farm lots, un-diluted by the typical cooperative- and exporter-level consolidations. The Single Farmer Lots Program represented a very sweet end to a chaotic chapter in Ethiopia\u2019s coffee history, and we think it was a foundational model for what is happening now: the emergence of a new generation of micro-exporters engaged in start-up relationship farming in Ethiopia\u2019s world-famous southern zones, putting more diversity and traceability into the global market than ever before.\u00a0\t\t",

Hirut originally acquired the Dumerso station in 2010\u2014Dumerso was originally established in 1998, but it had never been fully operational. Within 3 years Hirut had the station completely transformed, and 2013 was the first year Dumerso opened for business. The station now employs over 400 individuals during harvest season, 95% of whom are women, as well as a site manager and quality specialist, Abenet Alemu, who is responsible for maintaining the cup quality the area is famous for. Abenet was born and raised in Yirgacheffe, so his knowledge of local coffee systems and traditions is deep. As a result, in addition to his task of optimizing local quality through processing, he has a critical role to play in community relations on behalf of the station. In 2014 Hirut and her sister, Mahder Berhanu, formulated Dumerso Industrial Trading PLC, a milling, roasting, and exporting entity capable of placing their own coffees directly in the international market.\u00a0\n\nDuring harvest farmers deliver ripe cherries daily to the Dumerso mill. Processing begins at 6pm where the coffee is depulped and the parchment floated for density and as a pre-wash prior to fermentation. Fermentation is done underwater in open tanks for 36-48 hours depending on the day\u2019s local temperatures. Then the fermentation water is drained, during which the parchment coffee is briefly washed, and the clean parchment is moved to raised beds to dry. Drying takes 9-11 days depending on the day\u2019s local temperatures, during which the parchment is consistently tossed and rotated, but always kept at a maximum 3cm of depth. Final moisture at Dumerso is typically 9.5-11.5%.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNow that coffee processing and exporting is a well-run operation, the team at Dumerso Industrial Trading PLC is setting their sites on farmer benefits. Last harvest they achieved both organic and Rain Forest Alliance certification for the station, and they are currently undertaking a project to establish a local plant to convert coffee parchment into a kind of pressed firewood, as a way of boosting income for the station to distribute to growers and to help local farmers rely less on local forests for their daily source of fire. They have also financed the installation of local power equipment that supplies the majority of electricity to local residents. Hirut and Mahder also provide financial loans and healthcare for permanent staff, and lodging and accommodations for all seasonal washing station workers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\t\t",

In prior years, Adalila has sold her family's coffee in cherry to the local middleman. For the last 2 year she has been working with Catracha Coffee. During this time she has improved farm management practices using lime to control the pH of the soil, fertilizing with organic compost, and spraying organic fungicides to control levels of leaf rust.\u00a0 These actions have improved the health of her farm and the quality of his coffee production. Adalila has also learned to process coffee using her own micro-mill so that she can depulp, ferment and dry coffee before delivering it to Catracha Coffee.\u00a0 Adalila follows a strict processing protocol, which includes hand sorting to remove under ripe cherries and floating cherries to remove damaged and less dense beans.\u00a0 She also allows cherries to ferment slightly in the cool night air on raised beds before depulping the next day.\u00a0 This year, Adalila fermented the depulped coffee for 24 hours in barrels with water and Kombucha scobies covering the top of the slurry.\u00a0 After fermenting, she placed the coffee on raised beds to dry in the sun with the mucilage still attached to the seeds.\u00a0 The processing strategy maintains the same clean crisp acidity as a washed coffee with an additional fruit forward aroma and flavor.\u00a0 The process also lets Adalila skip the washing stage and significantly reduce water consumption. Adalila\u2019s farm has several different kinds of shade trees including Diphysa Americana (Guachipilin), Sweet Gum, (Liquidambar), and Inga (Guajiniquil).\u00a0 The farm also has a number of fruit bearing trees including several varieties of bananas, avocado, orange and mango trees.\n\nMayra Orellana-Powell founded Catracha Coffee Company to connect her coffee growing community with roasters. Ten years later, Catracha Coffee has gained momentum with more than 80 producers and 20 roasters working together on lasting relationships and a profit sharing model, which has consistently paid at least $2.00 per pound directly to producers. This extra income helps increase each producer\u2019s capacity to reinvest in their farm, and overtime, increase their standard of living.\n\nThe sale of Catracha Coffee also creates income for a non-profit called Catracha Community (a 501(1)(c)(3) nonprofit), which invests in income diversification opportunities without taking resources from a farmer\u2019s bottomline.\n\nCatracha Community hosts weekly workshops for women and youth to learn craft making skills. Like the coffee, the focus is on quality. With the help of talented volunteers, the group has been able to make many beautiful things and sell them through our network of coffee friends. They even have a name for the group, Catracha Colectivo.\n\nCatracha Community has also established an art residence and studio in Santa Elena to host artists from Honduras and around the world. These artists have been running art classes two days a week for over a year. Every week more than 30 children come and learn art. Art is starting to pop up everywhere around Santa Elena. There are more than 30 murals along the streets of Santa Elena, in peoples homes, and at many schools.\t\t",

Kenya, along with Kirinyaga and Nyeri counties to the west\u2014two of Kenya\u2019s most famous for quality. Individual farmers in these fertile foothills average 250 coffee trees each, and half-acre plots per family. The Ngurueri processing station, or \u201cfactory\u201d, as they\u2019re known in Kenya, is one of three sites managed by the Murue Farmer Cooperative Society (FCS), an umbrella organization that centralizes management and marketing relationships for their member factories. Murue FCS has 3 additional factories under its management: Kianyangi, Kavutiri, and Gituara.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nKenya is of course known for some of the most meticulous at-scale processing that can be found anywhere in the world. Bright white parchment, nearly perfectly sorted by density and bulk conditioned at high elevations is the norm, and a matter of pride, even for generations of Kenyan processing managers who prefer drinking Kenya\u2019s tea (abundantly farmed in Muranga county) to its coffee. Ample water supply in the central growing regions has historically allowed factories to wash, and wash, and soak, and wash their coffees again entirely with fresh, cold river water. Conservation is creeping into the discussion in certain places--understandably in the drier areas where water, due to climate change, cannot be as taken for granted\u2014including at Murue FCS where 2 years ago all factories replaced their disc pulpers with \u201cecopulpers\u201d, models which use far less water to depulp and clean parchment.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAt Ngurueri, cherry is hand-sorted for ripeness and floated for density before accepted and depulped each day.\u00a0 Fermentation occurs overnight, after which the coffee is washed in long cement grading channels, where it is agitated with fresh water and allowed to separate by density, producing 4 final grades of clean parchment. The coffee is then dried over a period of 9-15 days on raised beds, which are carefully constructed to ensure proper air circulation and temperature control for optimal drying.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201c14CE0001\u201d in the title refers to this coffee\u2019s \u201coutturn\u201d number. Outturn numbers are unique microlot codes that are given to each and every batch of parchment delivered to dry mills from individual factories or estates anywhere in Kenya, and are the units on which Kenya\u2019s entire microlot export system is built. Outturns in Kenya are tracked with a shorthand code that places the specific batch of parchment coffee in time, place, and sequentially with other coffees. Outturns are stylized as an 8 or 9-character code, including a 2-digit \u201ccoffee week\u201d number, a 2-letter mill code, and a 3 or 4-digit intake number for the coffee\u2019s delivery. This particular code accompanies the lot throughout the entire journey from factory to export to ensure full traceability.\u00a0\t\t",

Western Muranga County runs directly into the upland Aberdare Mountain range on rich red volcanic soil ideal for producing some of Kenya\u2019s best coffees.\nMuranga is an oblong county that sits between the industrious Kiambu County, to the south, and the most famous coffee counties of Kenya\u2019s central province: Nyeri, Kirinyaga, and Embu, to the north. The Aberdare range contributes significant climate influence over this part of Muranga, keeping the vegetation cooler and well-respirated, the way Mt. Kenya impacts its neighboring regions to the north. Coffees from Gondo factory tend to be rich and tangy, with syrupy texture and tart stone fruit notes.\nIndividual farmers in these fertile foothills average 250 coffee trees each, and half-acre plots per family. The Gondo processing station, or \u201cfactory\u201d, as they\u2019re known in Kenya, is one of three sites managed by the New Kiriti Farmers\u2019 Cooperative Society (FCS), an umbrella organization that centralizes management and marketing relationships for their member factories.

Conservation is creeping into the discussion in certain places--understandably in the drier areas where water, due to climate change, cannot be as taken for granted\u2014but for the most part Kenya continues to thoroughly wash and soak its coffees according to tradition.\nAt Gondo, cherry is hand-sorted for ripeness and floated for density before accepted and depulped each day. After the coffee is washed, it\u2019s soaked in fresh water for long periods of time to stop sugar fermentation and clean the parchment. The coffee is dried over a period of two weeks on raised beds, which are carefully constructed to ensure proper air circulation and temperature control for optimal drying.\nNew Kiriti FCS includes the Kayu and Kirimahiga factories along with Gondo. The society was founded in 1998 and retains its main office at the Kayu factory, 17 kilometers from Kangema town, in the Mathioya district of Muranga County.\t\t",

METAD is a third generation family owned business with a rich history that began after World War II when the Ethiopian Emperor awarded Muluemebet Emiru, the first African female pilot and family matriarch, with land in the Guji and Sidama zones that has become the Hambela Coffee Estate. METAD is managed by Aman Adinew who returned to Ethiopia after many years working abroad at the executive level for multiple fortune 500 companies because he wanted to make a difference for his family and community. Through Aman\u2019s leadership, METAD has strengthened the local community with employment opportunities including a workforce that is over seventy percent women, educational opportunities including university scholarships and sponsorship for a state-of-the-art elementary school with more than 700 students, and healthcare for employees. METAD was also first to partner with Grounds for Health in Ethiopia to implement a successful cervical cancer screening program for women within the coffee growing communities. METAD has an expanding Out-grower program designed to provide technical assistance, share modern farming equipment, and provide certification programs for more than 5,000 local farmers who are paid premiums for their cherry and second payments after coffee is sold. Quality and certification premiums have also helped METAD build roads and community centers. METAD has the first and only private state-of-the-art SCAA certified coffee quality control lab on the African continent used to train both domestic and international coffee professionals.\t\t",

Coffees here are earlier than in the far south, delicate, and citric.\u00a0Sidama\u00a0has one of the most robust cooperative unions in the country with 53 member cooperatives, as well as a thriving industry of independent washing stations.\u00a0Testi\u00a0Ayla is one such independent, owned\u00a0by\u00a0Testi\u00a0Coffee PLC and operated by\u00a0Faysel\u00a0Yonis.\u00a0\n\nThe\u00a0Testi\u00a0Ayla\u00a0washing station\u00a0is located in\u00a0Shanta\u00a0Wene, a small community in\u00a0eastern\u00a0Sidama, close to the\u00a0Harenna\u00a0Forest preserve. The\u00a01000 farmers delivering cherry to\u00a0Testi\u00a0Ayla\u00a0average two hectares each\u00a0in this area\u00a0and\u00a0some of the highest\u00a0elevations\u00a0in the whole of\u00a0Sidama.\u00a0There are three collection sites responsible for managing cherry delivery throughout the catchment area.\u00a0\n\nTesti\u00a0Ayla processes equal volumes of both fully washed and natural coffees\u00a0of the highest quality.\u00a0Washed lots at\u00a0Testi\u00a0Ayla\u00a0are fermented slowly\u201436 to 48 hours--due to the low ambient temperatures in the region and the replenishment of cold groundwater throughout\u00a0the process. Drying takes\u00a010-12\u00a0days and wet parchment is often covered during the\u00a0searingly-hot afternoon hours to protect it from cracking.\u00a0Naturals here take even longer\u00a0to dry, due to overnight low\u00a0temperatures and humidity, which\u00a0slow\u00a0dehydration.\u00a0The result is a clean, strawberry-like cup with abundant complexity.\u00a0It\u2019s\u00a0hard to find grade 1 naturals in\u00a0Sidama, as the vast majority of the zone\u2019s coffee tends to be washed, or\u00a0sundried of a lower grade.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nPrivate processors like\u00a0Testi\u00a0Ayla\u00a0are a thing to behold. It\u2019s a tough business being a private processor in\u00a0Sidama, as the sheer density of competition among washing stations tends to push cherry prices\u00a0high\u00a0throughout a single harvest, and privates often don\u2019t have the backing of a larger union to secure financing, regulate cherry prices, or bring export costs down with centralized milling and marketing. Successful private washing stations like\u00a0Testi\u00a0Ayla, then, need to be not only standout quality processors to stay afloat; they must also be excellent business developers with connections and community standing, in order to continue winning the business of farmers and buyers alike, and stay afloat for the long term.\u00a0\t\t",

The vast majority of coffee processing in Ethiopia is centralized due to complete lack of infrastructure or efficiencies at the farm level, but larger plots like Ayele\u2019s allow for greater personal control. This lot is Ayele\u2019s entire specialty crop, harvested with the assistance of about 7 workers, sorted for consistency, and sundried on his property on raised beds for about 3 weeks.\u00a0\n\nThere are precious few single-farm coffees available from this part of Ethiopia these days. Not long ago there were practically none at all. For the past 10 years, Royal, with support from select cooperatives, led the formation of the Single Farmer Lots Program, in order to break off single farmer lots from the larger cooperative blends sold anonymously through the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange (ECX), taking custody of these precious coffees through a direct sale. The program was a unique micro-channel of almost unprecedented specificity in coffee supply from Ethiopia during those first years. Farmers with the drive and means to sell direct were supported by Royal, and, in turn, our most enthusiastic buyers of Ethiopia coffee had access to a portfolio of single-farm lots, un-diluted by the typical cooperative- and exporter-level consolidations. The Single Farmer Lots Program represented a very sweet end to a chaotic recent chapter in Ethiopia\u2019s coffee history, and we think it was a foundational model for what is happening now: the emergence of a new generation of micro-exporters engaged in start-up relationship farming in Ethiopia\u2019s world-famous southern zones, putting more diversity and traceability into the global market than ever before.\u00a0\n\nAyele Dula\u2019s coffee is managed and exported by Konga Trading PLC, a recently-formed company owned by, who else, the former General Manager of the Yirgacheffe Coffee Farmers Cooperative Union (YCFCU), Takele Mammo.

Her family\u2019s journey in coffee is emblematic of the recent changes in the Ethiopian export rules, which in the past few years have opened new opportunities for individual farmers to export their own coffee, rather than limit exportation to cooperative unions and private companies.\nBedhatu is native to the Worka area in the Gedeb district of Yirgacheffe. Her late husband was granted the family land in the 1960s from the Ethiopian government. After he passed away in 1991, Bedhatu continued to single-handedly manage the farm while raising all six of their children. She eventually joined the larger Worka cooperative in 2011, and then the nearby Banko Gotiti cooperative when it formed in 2013, both part of the Yirgacheffe Coffee Farmers Cooperative Union (YCFCU). In the same year she was recognized as a model farmer by the union and became eligible for processing training that would allow her to prepare and sell her own coffee as a separate lot, marketed and handled by the union as part of a new program of differentiation. Bedhatu\u2019s sons had joined the family farm effort a few years prior, and with their help and the union\u2019s blessing (and Royal\u2019s enthusiasm!), the family eventually formulated a separate business entity that could export direct.\nThat business, Roba and Family Coffee, is perhaps the most successful single-farm exporter we know of in Gedeb. \u202fWhile the Roba family has expanded their reach to support other producers, we are always pleased to have an offering from Bedhatu\u2019s original 84-acre farm, which she has personally managed for over 50 years now without the use of chemical inputs.\u202f 84-acres is drastically larger than most farms in the area, and Bedhatu employs 20 year-round workers and another 130 seasonal workers for the harvest who are primarily women. The farm itself produces about 5 containers of exportable coffee each year, which is always among Royal\u2019s top qualities and one of the most sought-after Ethiopia profiles we carry.\n\nFor this natural lot, cherries are carefully hand sorted and floated to separate out less dense beans, then immediately spread out on raised beds in a single layer where it is dried over a period of 12 to 20 days and hand sorted continuously. The drying cherry is often covered in the mid-afternoons to prevent cracking or uneven evaporation during the hours of intense sun.\nAs a family owned business, emphasis on social impact in the communities where they source coffee is taking shape. The Roba family has invested in more localized cherry collection sites to reduce the transportation cost for other producers.\u202f They have also contributed to road construction projects that make travel a bit easier for everyone.\nAnnual farm visits from Royal CEO Max Nicholas-Fulmer and regular communication with farmers through Haile Andualem, Royal\u2019s representative on the ground in Ethiopia, has been an essential component for ensuring that farmers and washing stations are following strict farm management and post-harvest protocols to keep their coffees strong. For most newer single-farm exporters, the results have been increasing cup quality and higher returns for the individual producers over time. For Bedhatu and team, however, the coffee is simply always outstanding.\t\t",

The entire Gedeo zone is often referred to as \u201cYirgacheffe\u201d after this very district, by far its most famous for a long history of recognizable terroir.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n5.2 hectares is considered very large for this area, where half a hectare is the norm. The vast majority of coffee processing in Ethiopia is centralized due to complete lack of infrastructure or efficiencies at the farm level, but larger plots like Hirut\u2019s allow for greater personal control. This lot is Hirut\u2019s entire specialty crop, harvested with the assistance of about 7 workers, sorted for consistency, and sundried on her property on raised beds for about 3 weeks.\u00a0\n\nThere are precious few single-farm coffees available from this part of Ethiopia these days. Not long ago there were practically none at all. For the past 10 years, Royal, with support from select cooperatives, founded and led the Single Farmer Lots Program, in order to break off single farmer microlots from the larger cooperative blends sold anonymously through the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange (ECX), taking custody of these precious coffees through a direct sale. The program was a unique micro-channel of almost unprecedented specificity in coffee supply from Ethiopia during those first years. Farmers with the drive and means to sell direct were supported by Royal, and, in turn, our most enthusiastic buyers of Ethiopia coffee had access to a portfolio of single-farm lots, un-diluted by the typical cooperative- and exporter-level consolidations. The Single Farmer Lots Program represented a very sweet end to a chaotic chapter in Ethiopia\u2019s coffee history, and we think it was a foundational model for what is happening now: the emergence of a new generation of micro-exporters engaged in start-up relationship farming in Ethiopia\u2019s world-famous southern zones, putting more diversity and traceability into the global market than ever before.\u00a0\n\nHirut Shallo started processing and marketing her own coffee in 2019. She runs the farm together with her husband and 4 children, all of whom contribute to the farm\u2019s entrepreneurialism. Hirut\u2019s coffee is managed and exported by Konga Trading PLC, a recently-formed company owned by, who else, the former General Manager of the Yirgacheffe Coffee Farmers Cooperative Union (YCFCU), Takele Mammo. Takele was an instrumental partner of Royal\u2019s during his time at YCFCU, helping us identify and successfully export single farmer lots for the first time in the Union\u2019s long history.\u00a0\u00a0\t\t",

        "background": "\n\t\t\tCoffee Background\n\t\t\tKore is a municipality located near the center of the coveted\u202fGedeo\u202fZone\u2014the narrow section of highland plateau dense with savvy farmers and fiercely competitive processors whose coffee is known the world over as \u201cYirgacheffe\u201d, after the zone\u2019s most famous district. The Gedeo Zone is named for the Gedeo people who are indigenous to this area. As a coffee terroir, Gedeo, or \u201cYirgacheffe\u201d, has for decades been considered a benchmark for beauty and complexity in arabica coffee. It\u2019s known for being beguilingly ornate and jasmine-like when fully washed, and seductively punchy and sweet when sundried, and hardly requires an introduction.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nKore is in the district of Kochere, one of Gedeo\u2019s largest districts. Private processors here will often attempt to collaborate with select communities to keep the coffee traceable and the terroir focused. In this case, the washing station, managed by Adem Kedir, is called, simply, \u201cKochere\u201d (and isn\u2019t the only private named after the district). Kedir is a 3rd-generation coffee professional, inheriting knowledge from his grandfather and father. Unlike previous generations, both of whom who worked in Ethiopia\u2019s domestic marketplace, Adem exports coffee all over the world through his company, Ethio Gabana Trading.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAdem\u2019s station works directly with 634 farmers from the Boji, Kore, Buno, Baya, and Reko villages. The majority of these farmers own less than 0.5 hectares of land and typically divide their property between coffee, subsistence crops for the families, and items for the regional markets such as livestock or enset, a fruit-less relative of the banana tree whose pulp is fermented and then toasted as a staple food. Since the majority of these smallholders live below Ethiopia\u2019s poverty line, the quality premiums paid by the Kochere station make a significant difference to the community.\u00a0\n\nAt Kochere, cherry is hand-sorted upon delivery to ensure ripeness and uniformity and then spread very thinly on raised beds to dry, a process that typically takes 3 weeks. During drying the cherry is constantly rotated, and often covered during the midday sun, which at this altitude is often searingly hot during harvest and can crack the brittle parchment if exposed for even an hour too long.\u00a0\n\nPrivate processors like Kochere are admirable businesses. It\u2019s tough being a private processor in Gedeo, as the sheer density of competition among washing stations tends to push cherry prices as high as double throughout a single harvest, and privates often don\u2019t have the backing of a larger union to secure financing, regulate cherry prices, or bring export costs down with centralized milling and marketing. Successful private washing stations like Kochere, then, need to be not only standout quality processors to stay afloat; they must also be excellent business developers with connections and community standing, in order to continue winning the business of farmers and buyers alike, and stay afloat for the long term.\u00a0\u00a0\t\t",

        "background": "\n\t\t\tCoffee Background\n\t\t\tLoja is one of Ecuador\u2019s southernmost provinces, taking most of the country\u2019s Peruvian boarder. The region is almost entirely high elevation and is covered in numerous microclimates of p\u00e1ramo (alpine tundra) humid forests, and jungle. This stretch of the Andes, like nearby Cajamarca Province in Peru, is a kind of ecological bridge between the vast inland Amazonian basin to the east, and the coastal desert of northern Peru. It\u2019s a unique blend of humid and arid zones, with an elevation and fertility that privileges specialty coffee production and allows for the persistence of heirloom typica and bourbon lineage varieties increasingly unique to Ecuador and rare pockets of Peru.\u00a0\n\nBefore the development of Ecuador\u2019s northern estates, the Loja Province was synonymous with the country\u2019s coffee industry. And its production resembled that of neighboring Colombia and Peru: remote, small family plots picking and processing coffee by hand, represented through local growers\u2019 organizations, and generally speaking regionally homogenous profiles. Records held by the Ecuadorian Censo Nacional Econ\u00f3mico, the country\u2019s economic statistical office, show that coffee was first commercialized in the Loja region in 1820. So, coffee here is many generations old and is considered a meaningful heritage to thousands of landowners of indigenous descent.\u00a0\n\nFederaci\u00f3n Regional de Asociaciones de Peque\u00f1os Cafetaleros Ecol\u00f3gicos del Sur (FAPECAFES) was originally founded in 2005 and continues to mobilize and service 1800 small producer members. FAPECAFES members cultivate an average of 1.5 hectares apiece, which are often highly diversified: citrus fruits, bananas and papayas, yuca, corn, and sugar cane are all grown in addition to coffee, which is the land\u2019s primary source of income. In an effort to maximize their milling throughput, FAPECAFEs began leasing the use of their dry mill, and local exporter Capamaco Trading began using it to process coffees for export. Over time the groups began collaborating on coffees, with Capamaco curating select producers from within the FAPECAFES group, and marketing their coffees internationally.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThis lot is a small blend of 15 FAPECAFES smallholders who cultivate coffee in the Quilanga municipality, a mountainous community not far from the boarder with Peru. Each family farm is responsible for all harvesting and post-harvest processing on site: this typically consists of one small depulper machine, a single fermentation tank, and a small set of covered raised beds for drying. Once picked, coffee is typically fermented in cherry for 12-24 hours prior to depulping, and then fermented in mucilage for another 24-36 hours depending on the climate. Final washing is done in plastic or cement tanks with fresh water, and the coffee is then moved to the drying tables, where it\u2019s turned continuously for 15-25 days. Finished dried parchment is stored on site in nylon bags to help prevent the humidity from rising before delivery to the city of Loja, where each grower\u2019s coffee is analyzed and cupped for quality by the FAPECAFES team.\u00a0\t\t",

        "background": "\n\t\t\tCoffee Background\n\t\t\tGalo Fernando Morales Flores, along with his wife Maria Alexandra Rivera and his extended family, grow coffee on their 350-hectare plot in the community of San Jos\u00e9 de Minas, a small town in the northwestern part of Pichincha, a short trip north of Quito. They describe their farm, Finca Cruz Loma, as a marvelous paradise whose temperate, tropical climate allows for a huge variety of flora to thrive\u2014the family grows guan\u00e1bana (soursop), corn, beans, and a plethora of citrus\u2014all in addition to coffee.\n\nCoffee, though always a source of income, has recently brought a lot of recognition for Galo, Maria Alexandra, and the whole family, as winners of Pichincha\u2019s regional quality competition and as featured producers in Ecuador\u2019s national barista competition, both in 2019. In 2020, Cruz Loma took third place in the national \u201cTaza Dorada\u201d quality competition. Across residents and tourists alike Ecuador has a strong domestic market for roasted coffee, so honors such as these have no small impact on a farm\u2019s brand.\n\nFinca Cruz Loma has been in Galo\u2019s family going back 80 years. His grandparents were the first owners, who passed the property to their children, and now he and his four brothers are in charge. Galo\u2019s experience in coffee began 20 years ago working alongside his mother on the farm; he would go on to work professionally in the coffee sector, for exporters and as a project manager, before returning to full-time farming. In Galo\u2019s words, \u201ccultivating my coffee is an activity that allows me to apply and develop the skills and habits I\u2019ve learned over the years; it\u2019s also an essential resource for my family, since my wife, my daughters, and myself are all involved with the production and marketing of our coffee. Everybody in the family has a critical role in the coffee\u2019s success.\u201d\n\nTogether the family oversees four unique processes for their coffee: fully washed; \u201canaerobic\u201d washed, honey, and natural. This specific lot is a honey process with a slight twist to it. After picking, cherry is floated for density and then depulped; however, unlike a traditional honey process wherein cherry proceeds directly from depulping to drying, the Morales family prefers to add a short period of anaerobic fermentation. This brief step, an 8-hour ferment with the coffee just barely covered in water, is meant to break down some (but not all) of the remaining mucilage and develop the coffee\u2019s acidity profile. Once the fermentation is complete the coffee is moved to dry on covered raised beds, typically for 25-30 days. The result is most definitely a uniquely delicious honey process coffee: distinct confectionary sweetness, raspberry, pomegranate and red grape flavors, and punchy fruit acids are all evident in the cup.\n\nRemoving partial amounts of mucilage by design is not uncommon in honey processing. In fact, doing so gives the Morales family something very much in common with many of Costa Rica\u2019s best producers. Honey coffees are often mechanically de-mucilaged to different degrees in Costa Rica, according to each farm\u2019s preference; controlling mucilage levels this way in honey processing allows producers to develop highly-precise sweetness profiles and, if they choose, a variety of distinct honey processes from a single crop.\n\nThe principal harvest months in northern Pichincha are June to September, but the family continues picking through December. Ecuador\u2019s namesake position on the Earth\u2019s equator means that medium-altitude coffee enjoys practically a perfect year-round growing season, often with flowering and ripe cherry sharing the same branch most months.\t\t",

This coffee\u00a0is a blend of various small family farms from the Pichincha and Imbabura provinces, 150 hectares in total,\u00a0sourced and curated by Galo and Maria Alexandra.\u00a0\u201cChirimoya\u201d is the title for the small-farm blend, in honor of\u00a0the\u00a0native and\u00a0uniquely delicious fruit widely\u00a0grown and consumed across the Andes.\u00a0Principal harvest months in Pichincha\u00a0and Imbabura\u00a0are June to September, but farms often continue picking through December. Ecuador\u2019s namesake position on the Earth\u2019s equator means that medium-altitude coffee enjoys practically a perfect year-round growing season, often with flowering and ripe cherry sharing the same branch most months. For small farms this means a\u00a0small but long-term labor force to manage the slow, perfectionistic work required\u00a0for such a drawn-out harvest.\u00a0In addition to coffee it is common for farms in this area to grow any combination of potatoes,\u00a0plantains, corn, sugar cane,\u00a0cacao,\u00a0soursop and chirimoya,\u00a0and\u00a0heart of palm. \u00a0As everywhere in the coffee world, harvest on small farms typically\u00a0involves\u00a0the whole available family as well as hired pickers.\u00a0Coffee\u00a0in Pichincha and Imbabura is processed at home on personal equipment and\u00a0dried on\u00a0hand-made structures and greenhouses. Cherry is depulped immediately after picking and fermented for 20-26 hours. After fermentation,\u00a0the\u00a0parchment is thoroughly washed and\u00a0moved to raised beds under shade canopy for a slow and even drying stage.\u00a0 Galo\u00a0and\u00a0Maria Alexandra, the managers and curators of\u00a0this small-farm blend,\u00a0manage their own\u00a0Finca Cruz Loma,\u00a0a\u00a0350-hectare plot in the community of San Jos\u00e9 de Minas, a small town in the northwestern part of Pichincha, a short trip north of Quito. The estate has\u00a0been in Galo\u2019s family going back 80 years. Galo\u2019s experience in coffee began 20 years ago working alongside\u00a0his\u00a0mother on the farm;\u00a0he\u00a0would go on to work professionally in the\u00a0coffee sector, for exporters and as a project manager, before returning to full-time farming. In Galo\u2019s words, \u201ccultivating my coffee is an activity that allows me to apply and develop the skills and habits I\u2019ve learned over the years; it\u2019s also an essential resource for my family, since my wife, my daughters, and myself are all involved with the production and marketing of our coffee. Everybody in the family has a critical role in the coffee\u2019s success.\u201d Galo\u2019s experience in the value chain has positioned his family well to help create opportunities for other farms by representing their coffees to exporters and\u00a0directly to\u00a0Royal\u00a0Coffee.\u00a0\t\t",

        "background": "\n\t\t\tCoffee Background\n\t\t\tLoja and Zamora Chinchipe are two of Ecuador\u2019s southernmost provinces. This part of the country is almost entirely high elevation and is covered in numerous microclimates of p\u00e1ramo (alpine tundra) humid forests, and jungle. This stretch of the Andes is a kind of ecological bridge between the vast inland Amazonian basin to the east, and the coastal desert of northern Peru. It\u2019s a unique blend of humid and arid zones with an elevation and fertility that privileges specialty coffee production, particularly that of heirloom typica and bourbon lineage varieties increasingly unique to Ecuador and rare pockets of Peru. Zamora Chinchipe in particular, because of its closeness to the Amazon, is associated by Ecuadorians with an unparalleled natural wealth, and coffee producing areas are interspersed with national parks and protected forests.\u00a0\n\nBefore the development of Ecuador\u2019s northern estates, the Loja and Zamora Chinchipe provinces were synonymous with the country\u2019s coffee industry. And their production resembles that of neighboring Colombia and Peru: remote, small family plots picking and processing coffee by hand, represented through local growers\u2019 organizations, and generally speaking regionally homogenous profiles. Records held by the Ecuadorian Censo Nacional Econ\u00f3mico, the country\u2019s economic statistical office, show that coffee was first commercialized in the Loja region in 1820. So, coffee across Ecuador\u2019s south is many generations old and is considered a meaningful heritage to thousands of landowners of indigenous descent.\u00a0\n\nThis coffee is comprised of 20 individual growers, all of whom are 25-35 years old and who submitted their coffee to a quality competition run by their association, Asociaci\u00f3n Agroartesanal de Productores Ecol\u00f3gicos de Caf\u00e9 de Altura de Cant\u00f3n Palanda (APECAP). APECAP wanted to create a promotional contest that would help encourage younger generations to continue the vocation of coffee production, and the \u201cBracamoros\u201d competition was born. Each harvest, qualifying producers, all of whom recently inherited parcels of land from their senior family members, are given technical assistance, seedlings, farm inputs, and consulting from APECAP in exchange for their participation. All 85+ submissions are rewarded a place in the coveted blend, a price premium, and assortment of farming-related gifts (pruning equipment, etc.). The name \u201cBracamoros\u201d is a term used throughout the region to refer to the Andes\u2019 oldest recorded inhabitants: indigenous groups originally clustered in the Chinchipe river basin, which extends down through southern Ecuador and into Peru until it joins the historic Mara\u00f1on river and, eventually, the Amazon. As the name of a coffee blend from Zamora Chinchipe, the mantle is a source of pride, therefore, for APECAP and for younger generations of coffee producers, who embrace their heritage by persisting in sustainable farming in Zamora Chinchipe.\u00a0\n\nAs is common throughout the southern regions of Ecuador, each family farm is responsible for all harvesting and post-harvest processing on site: this typically consists of one small depulper machine, a single fermentation tank, and a small set of covered raised beds for drying. Once picked, coffee is typically fermented in cherry for 12-24 hours prior to depulping, and then fermented in mucilage for another 24-36 hours depending on the climate. Final washing is done in plastic or cement tanks with fresh water, and the coffee is then moved to the drying tables, where it\u2019s turned continuously for 15-25 days. Finished dried parchment is stored on site in nylon bags to help prevent the humidity from rising before delivery to the city of Palanda, where each grower\u2019s coffee is analyzed and cupped for quality by the APECAP team.\u00a0\n\nAPECAP is one of multiple grower associations that make up Federaci\u00f3n Regional de Asociaciones de Peque\u00f1os Cafetaleros Ecol\u00f3gicos del Sur (FAPECAFES). FAPECAFES was originally founded in 2005 and continues to mobilize and service 1800 small producer members. FAPECAFES members cultivate an average of 1.5 hectares apiece, which are often highly diversified: citrus fruits, bananas and papayas, yuca, corn, and sugar cane are all grown in addition to coffee, which is the land\u2019s primary source of income.\u00a0\u00a0\t\t",

His life and relationship with coffee is an amazing story to get to know. Ricardo\u2019s grandfather (an important statesman in the history of El Salvador) purchased the land in 1870 and named the finca after his wife, Leticia. Finca Santa Leticia was passed down to Ricardo during a time of great turmoil in El Salvador\u2019s history. At the peak of conflict in the 1980s, Ricardo came face to face with a firing squad in defense of his family\u2019s land. He was not shot but spent many years in exile before he was able to return to Finca Santa Leticia. Over the decades his career as a coffee producer has been challenged in just about every way you could imagine. Read more here. Today, Ricardo works with his daughter, Monica, to protect their groves of Pacamara and Bourbon varieties from leaf rust. In addition to coffee, Monica operates a beautiful hotel and restaurant at Finca Santa Leticia. Mayan artifacts that Ricardo\u2019s father discovered on the property have also been preserved as an archaeological site for visitors to enjoy. During the harvest a great deal of care and focus is dedicated to picking the best quality of cherry and gently drying it on clay patios.

Cherries are also turned regularly on the beds to prevent damage during the drying process. The cherries are stored in a local warehouse after the moisture is reduced to between 11.5 and 12 percent. Then the beans are transported to Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, to be milled and bagged prior to export. Girma\u2019s full control of the processing up to the final export stage, results in an exceptionally clean and sweet cup profile.\t\t",

Sidama has one of the most robust cooperative unions in the country with 53 member cooperatives, as well as a thriving industry of independent washing stations. Elilichew is one such independent, managed by Abel Tsegaye and servicing only 86 local farmers.\u00a0\n\nBensa district is in Sidama\u2019s eastern edge close to the Harenna Forest preserve and is a high-elevation area, even for Sidama, with farms up to 2200 meters. There are a number of independent processors working in the Bensa district and Elilichew is one of them. Elilichew is owned by G. Global Coffee, who oversees export logistics. G. Global also maintains an equity-based charity as part of its business model, called Project Zaakaa, where 2.5% of the total company assets are granted for local infrastructure projects and labor.\u00a0\n\nFresh-picked cherry is delivered daily to Elilichew where it is sorted on arrival, depulped, and fermented. Once fermentation is complete the coffee is washed clean and moved to raised beds to dry, where it is turned every 2-3 hours for the first few days to encourage equal outer drying. After this first drying stage the coffee is rotated less often and continues drying until optimal moisture is reached, at which point the dry parchment is transported to a local ware house to condition for 21 days before being trucked to Addis Ababa, where it is dry-milled for export.\u00a0\t\t",

It is a remote but impressively industrious area for coffee production. Of the 1300 hectares that comprise the area, over half of them are planted with coffee. Up to a few years ago when coffee exports were allowed only limited channels, the vast majority of coffee grown in this area was either processed and exported by the Yirgacheffe Coffee Farmers Cooperative Union (YCFCU), consolidated under the wide-reaching Worka Cooperative, or sold anonymously through the Ethiopia Commodity Exchange (ECX). Today, however, in addition to the Worka Cooperative splitting into multiple smaller coops, there are increasing numbers of single farm owners and independent companies who are processing and exporting direct. It is an exciting time to be buying in Gedeb, where we expect to see new layers of coffee continuously unfold as its local industry accelerates.\nThe Worka Sakaro washing station is owned and operated by Tracon Coffee, an independent exporter who manages 6 stations total in Gedeo. 852 individual smallholders contribute to Worka Sakaro, each averaging 1.6 hectares of coffee, and most of them also producing enset\u2014a fruit-less relative of the banana tree whose pulp is scraped and packed into cakes, fermented underground, and then toasted as kocho, a staple starch in the area.\nAt Worka Sakaro, natural processed coffees are typically sorted by hand on arrival to the processing site and then taken directly to raised beds to fully dry, a process that takes about 21 days. This particular lot however received a unique twist on the traditional natural: fresh cherry is first vacuum sealed in stainless steel canisters for 4-5 days, creating an environment deprived of oxygen and increasingly pressurized by the carbon dioxide emitted in the fermentation of the fresh fruit. Once the vacuum fermentation is complete, the cherry, now pale yellow from loss of pigment, is transferred directly to raised beds to sun-dry for 15-18 days until the moisture is reduced to the level of a typical complete natural.\nOxygen-deprived, or \u201canaerobic\u201d fermentation environments like the above have gained traction among processing wonks in coffee for the unique flavors and tanginess they can add, as well as creating exaggerated characteristics in the cup compared to what we\u2019re used to. In this case, Tracon has created a distinctly intense and tropical fruit-dominant natural profile with soft acids and a structure that is both creamy and juicy. It is a unique digression from the mainstream for sure, and an objectively successful result.\t\t",

The municipality of Gedeb itself is a is a bustling outpost that links commerce between the Guji and Gedeo Zones. It contains an expansive network of processing stations who buy cherry from across zone borders. Coffee producers here would argue (and we would agree) their coffee profiles are not exactly Yirgacheffe, but something of their own. The communities surrounding Gedeb reach some of the highest growing elevations for coffee in the world and are a truly enchanting part of the long drive into Guji. Coffees from this area, much closer to the Guji Zone than the rest of Yirgacheffe, can be some the more explosive cup profiles we see from anywhere in Ethiopia. Naturals tend to have perfume-like volatiles, and fully washed lots are often sparklingly clean and fruit candy-like in structure.\u00a0\n\n5 hectares is considered quite large for this area, where half a hectare is the norm. The vast majority of coffee processing in Ethiopia is centralized due to complete lack of infrastructure or efficiencies at the farm level, but larger plots like Shibru\u2019s allow for greater personal control. Shibru grew up assisting his family\u2019s coffee harvest, and now with a family and farms of his own, has succeeded in securing an export license, a major feat for a modest size farmer in Ethiopia. His farm typically hires 60 employees, a lot for a property of this size, to cover all harvesting and processing. Handpicked cherry is all floated for density and then placed directly onto drying beds, where they will be consistently turned and rotated for the few weeks that drying requires. The beds are covered at night, to protect the cherry from settling humidity, as well as for a few hours each afternoon, to prevent scorching from the searingly-hot midday sun.\u00a0\n\nThere are precious few single-farm coffees available from this part of Ethiopia these days. Not long ago there were practically none at all. For the past 10 years, Royal, with support from select cooperatives, led the formation of the Single Farmer Lots Program, in order to break off single farmer lots from the larger cooperative blends sold anonymously through the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange (ECX), taking custody of these precious coffees through a direct sale. The program was a unique micro-channel of almost unprecedented specificity in coffee supply from Ethiopia during those first years. Farmers with the drive and means to sell direct were supported by Royal, and, in turn, our most enthusiastic buyers of Ethiopia coffee had access to a portfolio of single-farm lots, un-diluted by the typical cooperative- and exporter-level consolidations. The Single Farmer Lots Program represented a very sweet end to a chaotic chapter in Ethiopia\u2019s coffee history, and we think it was a foundational model for what is happening now: the emergence of a new generation of micro-exporters engaged in start-up relationship farming in Ethiopia\u2019s world-famous southern zones, putting more diversity and traceability into the global market than ever before.\u00a0\u00a0\t\t",

As a coffee terroir, this part of Gedeo has for decades been considered a benchmark for beauty and complexity in arabica coffee\u2014known for being beguilingly ornate and jasmine-like when fully washed, and seductively punchy and sweet when sundried--and hardly requires an introduction.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n3 hectares considered large for this area, where half a hectare is the norm. The vast majority of coffee processing in Ethiopia is centralized due to complete lack of infrastructure or efficiencies at the farm level, but larger plots like Kefyalew\u2019s allow for greater personal control. Kefyalew grew up assisting his family\u2019s coffee harvest, and now with a 5-member family of his own, he has succeeded in securing an export license, a major feat for even a farmer of this size in Ethiopia. Kefyalew\u2019s farm typically hires about 50 employees during harvest, a lot for a property of this size, to cover all picking and processing. Handpicked cherry is all floated for density and then placed directly onto drying beds, where they are consistently turned and rotated for the few weeks that drying requires. The beds are covered at night to protect the cherry from settling humidity, as well as for a few hours each afternoon to prevent scorching from the searingly-hot midday sun.\u00a0\n\nThere are precious few single-farm coffees available from this part of Ethiopia these days. Not long ago there were practically none at all. For the past 10 years, Royal, with support from select cooperatives, led the formation of the Single Farmer Lots Program, in order to break off single farmer lots from the larger cooperative blends sold anonymously through the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange (ECX), taking custody of these precious coffees through a direct sale. The program was a unique micro-channel of almost unprecedented specificity in coffee supply from Ethiopia during those first years. Farmers with the drive and means to sell direct were supported by Royal, and, in turn, our most enthusiastic buyers of Ethiopia coffee had access to a portfolio of single-farm lots, un-diluted by the typical cooperative- and exporter-level consolidations. The Single Farmer Lots Program represented a very sweet end to a chaotic chapter in Ethiopia\u2019s coffee history, and we think it was a foundational model for what is happening now: the emergence of a new generation of micro-exporters engaged in start-up relationship farming in Ethiopia\u2019s world-famous southern zones, putting more diversity and traceability into the global market than ever before.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\t\t",

Gedeo is a narrow section of highland plateau dense with savvy farmers and fiercely competitive processors, and has been known commercially as Yirgacheffe for many years after the Yirgacheffe district itself, one of Ethiopia\u2019s first areas to fully wash its coffee. As a coffee terroir, Yirgacheffe has for decades been considered a benchmark for beauty and complexity in arabica coffee\u2014known for being beguilingly ornate and jasmine-like when fully washed, and seductively punchy and sweet when sundried--and hardly requires an introduction.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAdorsi is a very young washing station, having only been first established in 2018. Adorsi is owned and operated by Testi Trading PLC, the same suppliers behind some of our top-scoring Sidama coffees we buy each year from Testi Ayla washing station. Testi Trading has grown a lot in the past few years and are a big part of the growth of independent processors and exporters in Ethiopia\u2019s very competitive south doing the good, laborious work of processing differentiation, traceability, and pushing quality boundaries.\u00a0\n\nAdorsi\u2019s farmer contributors are typical in size for the area, which is to say, tiny: half a hectare of coffee per farmer is the average. Cherry is delivered to the washing station daily throughout the harvest months, where it is depulped and fermented for 36-48 hours depending on the local climate. After fermentation is complete the wet parchment is washed in long channels to scrub off residual mucilage and float off the lowest density coffee. Drying occurs under parabolic shade netting for 5-7 days and rotated consistently until reaching a final resting moisture content of 11-12 percent.\u00a0\n\nPrivate processors like Adorsi are admirable businesses. It\u2019s tough being a private processor in Gedeo, as the sheer density of competition among washing stations tends to push cherry prices as high as double throughout a single harvest, and privates often don\u2019t have the backing of a larger union to secure financing, regulate cherry prices, or bring export costs down with centralized milling and marketing. Successful private washing stations like Adorsi, then, need to be not only standout quality processors to stay afloat; they must also be excellent business developers with connections and community standing, in order to continue winning the business of farmers and buyers alike, and stay afloat for the long term. Testi Trading invests in local education among its communities, including in the Aricha kebele, where it has built 2 primary schools (and has already done similar work in Guji, West Arsi, and Shantawene, Sidama).\u00a0\u00a0\t\t",

Hirut originally acquired the Dumerso station in 2010\u2014Dumerso was originally established in 1998, but it had never been fully operational. Within 3 years Hirut had the station completely transformed, and 2013 was the first year Dumerso opened for business. The station now employs over 400 individuals during harvest season, 95% of whom are women, as well as a site manager and quality specialist, Abenet Alemu, who is responsible for maintaining the cup quality the area is famous for. Abenet was born and raised in Yirgacheffe, so his knowledge of local coffee systems and traditions is deep. As a result, in addition to his task of optimizing local quality through processing, he has a critical role to play in community relations on behalf of the station. In 2014 Hirut and her sister, Mahder Berhanu, formulated Dumerso Industrial Trading PLC, a milling, roasting, and exporting entity capable of placing their own coffees directly in the international market.\u00a0\n\nDuring harvest farmers deliver ripe cherries daily to the Dumerso mill. Processing begins at 6pm where the coffee is depulped and the parchment floated for density and as a pre-wash prior to fermentation. Fermentation is done underwater in open tanks for 36-48 hours depending on the day\u2019s local temperatures. Then the fermentation water is drained, during which the parchment coffee is briefly washed, and the clean parchment is moved to raised beds to dry. Drying takes 9-11 days depending on the day\u2019s local temperatures, during which the parchment is consistently tossed and rotated, but always kept at a maximum 3cm of depth. Final moisture at Dumerso is typically 9.5-11.5%.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNow that coffee processing and exporting is a well-run operation, the team at Dumerso Industrial Trading PLC is setting their sites on farmer benefits. Last harvest they achieved both organic and Rain Forest Alliance certification for the station, and they are currently undertaking a project to establish a local plant to convert coffee parchment into a kind of pressed firewood, as a way of boosting income for the station to distribute to growers and to help local farmers rely less on local forests for their daily source of fire. They have also financed the installation of local power equipment that supplies the majority of electricity to local residents. Hirut and Mahder also provide financial loans and healthcare for permanent staff, and lodging and accommodations for all seasonal washing station workers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\t\t",

The entire station occupies only 0.55 hectares of land and processes coffee. For its first few years of operation the station processed coffee from local cherry aggregators, until the Boledu family felt they had processing fundamentals and infrastructure in place, including things like planting specific trees to serve as windbreakers during harvest season. Today, however, the station is processing both fully washed and sundried natural, purchased directly from over 1200 individual farmers in total, making the Boledus\u2019 Halo Bariti station a strong part of the local community.\nFarmers in this area average less than 2 hectares per household and in addition to coffee cultivate avocado, soy beans, sugar cane, and enset, a fruitless relative of the banana tree whose inner pulp is scraped, packed into cakes, fermented undergound, and then toasted and consumed as a staple starch. Naturals at Halo Bariti are received direct from participating farms, sorted for consistency and quality, and then taken directly to raised beds to dry for 2-3 weeks during which they are constantly rotated and covered each evening.\t\t",

Gedeo, named after the Gedeo people indigenous to the area, is a narrow section of highland plateau dense with savvy farmers and fiercely competitive processors whose coffee is known the world over as \u201cYirgacheffe\u201d, after the zone\u2019s most famous district and central town.\nAs a terroir, Yirgacheffe has for decades been considered a benchmark for beauty and complexity in arabica coffee, known for being beguilingly ornate and jasmine-like when fully washed, and seductively punchy and sweet when sundried--and hardly requires an introduction. This particular coffee from a family-run independent washing station in Halo Hartume, is no exception. It\u2019s big and sweet, with layers of grapefruit and lavender-like florality.\nThe Halo Hartume station was started by Mijane Woresa in 2013. For its first few years the station sold coffee the way most producers in the area did: through the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange (ECX), where government cuppers would grade and position the coffee for sale to exporters. In 2017 Mr. Woresa secured an export license for himself, and, after 30 years of work in coffee, brought his son Daniel aboard, who then started a relationship with Royal. Today, Daniel Mijane runs the majority of day-to-day operations at the family\u2019s two private stations (the other is in Worka Sakaro, in the southeastern corner of Gedeb), as well as the exporting itself, and the coffee has become his namesake.\nHalo Hartume\u2019s contributing farmers number almost 400, and farm sizes range from 1 to 10 hectares. The Mijane family\u2019s involvement with farmers begins long before harvest in the form of harvest trainings and the establishment of seasonal collection sites\u2014local delivery points that reduce overland travel for farmers and provide a quality inspection point for the washing station.\nDuring harvest season, bulk deliveries come in from the collection sites around 6pm, where Halo Hartume conducts a final inspection for uniform ripeness, foreign matter, and overall quality, before admitting cherry to the tables for drying. Once transported, cherry will dry in the sun, continuously rotated and aerated for 1-2 weeks week. Naturals at Halo Hartume are typically covered during the hottest hours of the day, 11:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., when the intensity of the sun risks creating mold or uneven humidity across even a single layer of cherry.\nPrivate processors like Halo Hartume are a thing to behold. It\u2019s a tough business being a private processor in Gedeo, as the sheer density of competition among washing stations tends to push cherry prices as high as double throughout a single harvest, and privates often don\u2019t have the backing of a larger union to secure financing, regulate cherry prices, or bring export costs down with centralized milling and marketing. Successful private washing stations like the Mijane family\u2019s, then, need to be not only standout quality processors to stay afloat; they must also be excellent business developers with connections and community standing, in order to continue winning the business of farmers and buyers alike, and stay afloat for the long term.\t\t",

Gedeo, named after the Gedeo people indigenous to the area, is a narrow section of highland plateau dense with savvy farmers and fiercely competitive processors whose coffee is known the world over as \u201cYirgacheffe\u201d, after the zone\u2019s most famous district and central town.\nAs a terroir, Yirgacheffe has for decades been considered a benchmark for beauty and complexity in arabica coffee, known for being beguilingly ornate and jasmine-like when fully washed, and seductively punchy and sweet when sundried--and hardly requires an introduction. This particular coffee from a family-run independent washing station in Halo Hartume, is no exception. It\u2019s big and sweet, with layers of grapefruit and lavender-like florality.\nThe Halo Hartume station was started by Mijane Woresa in 2013. For its first few years the station sold coffee the way most producers in the area did: through the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange (ECX), where government cuppers would grade and position the coffee for sale to exporters. In 2017 Mr. Woresa secured an export license for himself, and, after 30 years of work in coffee, brought his son Daniel aboard, who then started a relationship with Royal. Today, Daniel Mijane runs the majority of day-to-day operations at the family\u2019s two private stations (the other is in Worka Sakaro, in the southeastern corner of Gedeb), as well as the exporting itself, and the coffee has become his namesake.\nHalo Hartume\u2019s contributing farmers number almost 400, and farm sizes range from 1 to 10 hectares. The Mijane family\u2019s involvement with farmers begins long before harvest in the form of harvest trainings and the establishment of seasonal collection sites\u2014local delivery points that reduce overland travel for farmers and provide a quality inspection point for the washing station.\nDuring harvest season, bulk deliveries come in from the collection sites around 6pm, where Halo Hartume conducts a final inspection for uniform ripeness, foreign matter, and overall quality, before admitting cherry to the tables for drying. Once transported, cherry will dry in the sun, continuously rotated and aerated for 1-2 weeks week. Naturals at Halo Hartume are typically covered during the hottest hours of the day, 11:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., when the intensity of the sun risks creating mold or uneven humidity across even a single layer of cherry.\nPrivate processors like Halo Hartume are a thing to behold. It\u2019s a tough business being a private processor in Gedeo, as the sheer density of competition among washing stations tends to push cherry prices as high as double throughout a single harvest, and privates often don\u2019t have the backing of a larger union to secure financing, regulate cherry prices, or bring export costs down with centralized milling and marketing. Successful private washing stations like the Mijane family\u2019s, then, need to be not only standout quality processors to stay afloat; they must also be excellent business developers with connections and community standing, in order to continue winning the business of farmers and buyers alike, and stay afloat for the long term.\t\t",

        "background": "\n\t\t\tCoffee Background\n\t\t\tAndres Fahsen is the 5th generation of his family to manage the 56-hectare Finca Patzibir, an organic farm on the slopes of Volc\u00e1n Tolim\u00e1n, one of the most prominent natural features of the breathtaking Lake Atitl\u00e1n.\u00a0\n\nPatzibir sits in the municipality of San Lucas Tolim\u00e1n, on the southern shore of the lake near the border between the departments of Solol\u00e1 and Chimaltenango. Atitl\u00e1n is considered a place of ancient importance and still home to some of Guatemala\u2019s most visible indigenous communities. Atitl\u00e1n\u2019s surface sits at almost 1600 meters and is a volcanic basin surrounded by dramatically steep escarpments, and, including Tolim\u00e1n, numerous volcanoes. Humidity along the escarpments is high throughout the year, where low-moving clouds blend into forests and filter the sunlight. As one might imagine, in the right hands the terroir here is exquisite for coffee. And a lot of coffee is grown in various communities around the lake, many of whom still successfully grow typica and bourbon, the first varieties planted in the area. However, it is rare to find coffee from single estates such as Patzibir. Most of the coffee from Atitl\u00e1n is smallholder grown and either cooperatively represented or bought by independent processors at competitive local rates.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nPatzibir requires some specific arrangements to succeed as an organic farm. First, the slopes are terraced and coffee is interplanted with different types of grass, which help retain moisture and nutrients in the soil that would otherwise wash away. The grass itself is also used to feed the coffee\u2014once it\u2019s cut the roots decompose and release their own stored nutrition to the roots of the coffee, as well as aerating the soil. The shade canopy is pruned to precision to allow optimal sunlight into the farm, and coffee trees are also generously spaced on their terraces, allowing for the minimal sunlight to photosynthesize the lowest branches, maximizing production on the whole tree. Spacing also allows air to flow through the entire tree, preventing mold and fungus from generating in Patzibir\u2019s humid climate.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cPatzibir\u201d is a Kaqchikel word meaning \u201cwhere the Tzibir tree lives\u201d, in reference to a native tree species in the region, which makes up part of Patzibir\u2019s canopy.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe cherry harvested at Patzibir is processed in the city of Antigua, at the wet mill of Los Volcanes Coffee, a processor, quality consultant, and exporter from whom Royal buys a wide variety of coffees. At Los Volcanes\u2019 wet mill, cherry is delivered daily throughout harvest where it is sorted for uniformity, depulped, and fermented for up to 48 hours in a covered, temperature-controlled warehouse of ceramic tanks. Los Volcanes employs dedicated processing managers calibrated to a combination of temperature and smell to manage precise degrees of fermentation and maintain consistency across batches of varying volumes, temperatures, and humidity levels. After fermentation is complete, parchment is passed through a pressurized water siphon for cleaning and density grading, and then dried on the site\u2019s large patio or in mechanical dryers. As batches of parchment finish drying throughout the harvest, the Los Volcanes team works with each individual lot in their cupping lab, blind-tasting and building harmonious lots by producer or region, for international sale.\u00a0\t\t",

        "background": "\n\t\t\tCoffee Background\n\t\t\t\u201cStopped in our tracks\u201d might be an appropriate description of the effect this coffee had on us when we first cupped it a few years ago. Such lush tropical fruit notes and zesty acidity accompanied by delightful sweetness and velvety mouthfeel, we kept coming back to this coffee from the Cob\u00e1n region of Guatemala, part of the country\u2019s rainforest-covered Alta Verapaz department, to have another taste. Most roasters have ample experience with southern or western Guatemala thanks to the proliferation of balanced and caramel-sweet profiles across these regions, their robust producing history and established infrastructure, and enduring reputations in the specialty world. Cob\u00e1n, on the other hand, tends to be overlooked in specialty buying, despite being one of the country\u2019s top producing regions and having an official quality designation by Guatemala\u2019s own national coffee sector, Anacaf\u00e9. And, despite having producers like Luis Valdez who, in our opinion, is one of the best anywhere in Central America.\n\nFinca Santa Isabel is a 70-hectare estate in just outside the town of San Crist\u00f3bal Verapaz, down the highway from the region\u2019s namesake city of Cob\u00e1n. Luis Vald\u00e9s, affectionately called \u201cWicho\u201d to distinguish him from his father and grandfather who are also named Luis, has been running Santa Isabel, and the family\u2019s adjacent farm San Lorenzo, since 1999. Wicho started following his father around the estate when he was young and later earned an agricultural engineering degree before taking the reins. Constant humidity and precipitation year-round in this area creates some extremely complex challenges for processing and drying in particular. So much so that coffee from Cob\u00e1n is often stereotyped as being heavy in the cup and dull, or earthy. Wicho, however, has used his life-long experience and education to overcome this obstacle. The entire estate is terraced to protect against erosion during the heavy summer rains. Wicho has also created several different drying strategies (raised beds, greenhouses, and mechanical dryers) to cope with the unpredictability of winter rains during the harvest. Each dried outturn of coffee is conditioned and then cupped and grouped into individual profiles; the \u201cfloral\u201d profile is created with individual day lots that Wicho and his partners believe express the most complex and effusive aromatics of the harvest.\n\nDried parchment is taken from the estate to a dry mill in Guatemala City. San Isabel is equipped with multiple pieces of equipment to sort green coffee typical in most dry mills, such as, gravity beds, screens and electronic eyes. The mill also has a piece of equipment called a catadora, which is placed immediately after the dehuller and operates like a wind channel to remove broken and less dense coffee beans. Mild weather in Guatemala City provides ideal conditions for storing parchment in the warehouse until it is time to export.\n\nIn the past 10 years Wicho\u2019s coffee has become some of the most sought-after in Guatemala. He is a kind, studious, experienced, and determined coffee producer capable of managing great complexity. A normal day during harvest includes calibrating 500 pickers on each variety in the field, daily processing, multiple simultaneous drying scenarios, over 200 hectares of coffee and forest management to keep thriving, experimental variety plots to plan, and a constantly threatening climate to monitor hour by hour. It takes quite a producer to get all the variables just right.\t\t",

This part of Honduras is extremely well respected for coffee quality. So much so that in 2005 the region received Honduras\u2019 first Denominaci\u00f3n de Origen (DO) for coffee, which, similar to American Viticulture Areas (AVAs), certifies the region\u2019s terroir and final products as being authentic so as to protect its exports from adulteration or imitation. The DO designation applies to Honduras\u2019 mountainous southwestern region and includes parts of Intibuc\u00e1, La Paz, and Comayagua, although it is simply named \u201cDO Marcala\u201d after the central municipality itself, which is considered the region\u2019s capital of coffee heritage.\u00a0\n\nJust like in any gifted, challenging coffee terroir in Central America, farms in the Marcala area range from large and historic to small and familial. The region has a variety of exemplary coffee organizations, from organic cooperatives to private mills and independent producer groups whose organized efforts have brought a lot of recognition to the potential of Marcala\u2019s small farms in recent years.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nProyecto Caba\u00f1as is one such group. It is a central processing project that currently services 65 small farms across the Caba\u00f1as community, a sprawling and remote area in the complex ridgelines along the Honduras-El Salvador border, due south of Marcala city. Participating farms average only 2.5 hectares apiece and are managed by immediate family.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe processing project was first established in 2012. Farms across the region were struggling to survive after a roya (coffee leaf rust) outbreak devastated the predominant coffee cultivars in production\u2014cultivars like typica and pacas, both excellent in the cup but highly susceptible to illness. Many of the farms had only recently been established, as coffee in Caba\u00f1as was not typically cultivated until the year 2000 when landowners saw the potential of planting it. The newer, state-sponsored hybrids farmers planted to replace their loss, such as Lempira and Ihcafe-90, needed help maximizing quality. San Vicente, a miller, exporter, and marketing group based in Honduras\u2019 Santa B\u00e1rbara department, was first introduced to farmers in Caba\u00f1as by one of their producers, Alex Ponce, who has family in the region. The project began with only 3 producers, a single pulping machine, and 3 raised beds on a rented plot of land. Now, 10 years later, the group is much larger and the project is producing a wide variety of processing styles. And Alex Ponce is still the general manager of the project.\u00a0\n\nThis particular lot is what the San Vicente team calls an \u201canaerobic washed\u201d process. Coffee cherries are received daily from participating farmers and put directly into plastic barrels that are sealed and impervious to oxygen, where they rest and ferment anaerobically for 72 hours. After this first fermentation the barrels are open and the fermented cherry is then depulped and de-mucilaged via water friction. Finally, the clean parchment is moved to raised beds to dry, where it is rotated every 30 minutes during the day for about 2 weeks, and sorted constantly by hand to remove all visible defects.\u00a0 At the station all day lots are kept separate for quality purposes. This lot is a single day\u2019s lot of processing. Cups are subtle and chocolatey, with a dried fruit sweetness, sweet coriander, and a fudgy, creamy body.\u00a0\t\t",

This part of Honduras is extremely well respected for coffee quality. So much so that in 2005 the region received Honduras\u2019 first Denominaci\u00f3n de Origen (DO) for coffee, which, similar to American Viticulture Areas (AVAs), certifies the region\u2019s terroir and final products as being authentic so as to protect its exports from adulteration or imitation. The DO designation applies to Honduras\u2019 mountainous southwestern region and includes parts of Intibuc\u00e1, La Paz, and Comayagua, although it is simply named \u201cDO Marcala\u201d after the central municipality itself, which is considered the region\u2019s capital of coffee heritage.\u00a0\n\nJust like in any gifted, challenging coffee terroir in Central America, farms in the Marcala area range from large and historic to small and familial. The region has a variety of exemplary coffee organizations, from organic cooperatives to private mills and independent producer groups whose organized efforts have brought a lot of recognition to the potential of Marcala\u2019s small farms in recent years.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nProyecto Caba\u00f1as is one such group. It is a central processing project that currently services 65 small farms across the Caba\u00f1as community, a sprawling and remote area in the complex ridgelines along the Honduras-El Salvador border, due south of Marcala city. Participating farms average only 2.5 hectares apiece and are managed by immediate family.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe processing project was first established in 2012.

Each year we make at least one community blend to showcase the diversity of the Santa Elena profile and the consistency in processing among the group. This year we made a peaberry lot, which was possible because the mill where we prepare coffee for export, Villa Florida, has the capacity to sort coffee by screen size. Peaberries, a small round shaped bean formed from the maturation of one seed per cherry rather than the typical two seeds, consistently falls into the smallest screen, which allows for the separation. And of course the lot was passed through all the other sorting equipment like the electronic eye to remove discolored coffee, and hand sorted to remove anything that the machines could not catch Consistency in the community blend can be attributed to a harmony of farm management and processing strategies because each producer attends monthly workshops to learn farm management practices such as applying lime to control the pH of the soil, fertilizing with organic compost, and spraying organic fungicides to control levels of leaf rust. They have also learned to process coffee using the same procedures at each individual micro-mill to depulp, ferment and dry coffee before delivering it to Catracha Coffee.

        "background": "\n\t\t\tCoffee Background\n\t\t\tKiambu county sits adjacent to Nairobi, Kenya\u2019s capital city, and is a coffee powerhouse. Along with an extensive community of coffee mills, exporter warehouses and quality labs, and the Coffee Research Institute (near Ruiru Town, after which the disease-resistant hybrid is named), Kiambu is also home to many of Kenya\u2019s largest and oldest coffee estates. Despite the vast number of smallholder farmers in Kenya the estate system persists, and in many cases reflects both Kenya\u2019s colonial origins and its current identity as a self-actualized producer of some of the world\u2019s most obsessed-over profiles.\nCoffee\u2019s history in Kenya is astonishingly short compared to Ethiopia, its neighbor to the north, with the introduction of coffee occurring around the turn of the 19th century at the hands of British missionaries who brought bourbon-lineage coffee trees from Brazil. As the value of the cash crop grew in the European marketplace, the British settlers would force indigenous Africans out of the trade by outlawing coffee production outside their colonial estate network. This however did not stop the British from requiring unpaid labor from the same population to further reduce their costs and boost output for the colony. It wouldn\u2019t be until the years of conflict prior to Kenya\u2019s independence, from 1952-1960, that indigenous Africans would be permitted to plant coffee\u2014although for years afterward plantings were severely limited and none of the coffee produced by smallholders was permitted to be consumed.\nSince independence, the large estate holdings have evolved to reflect Kenya\u2019s modern demographic: ownership can be single families, corporations, or groups of shareholders. In the case of Muiri Estate, a 443-acre farm with 216 acres of planted coffee, it is a local family and management team.\nThe estate is named after an African tree species, the Prunus Africana\u2014or \u201cmuiri\u201d in the local Kikuyu language. Muiri has over 150,000 coffee trees in production and 94,000 old and new-growth trees for shade throughout the property. Estates of this size with no mechanization for harvesting require massive amounts of labor, and Muiri has developed not only a cottage community for its staff, but has also donated enough of its own land for 1,000 families to grow beans, a common household staple in Kenya. The property uses a dam to gather fresh water for fermentation, which is then re-used for moving cherry through the pulper before placing it in seepage pits for filtration.\nMuiri is organic certified. This is not to be overlooked, particularly in Kenya whose delicate cultivars, smallholder-dominant system, ageing trees, and climate change leave very little room to reduce fertilizer and pesticide use, as a matter of survival for hundreds of thousands. Muiri\u2019s formidable resources, however, are being used in the right direction. They have been certified since 2008 and continuing to raise and process beautiful coffees using wholly organic inputs and canopy management.\t\t",

        "background": "\n\t\t\tCoffee Background\n\t\t\tMany of us are accustomed to Kenya coffees being organized and sold in very small volumes that correspond to one specific estate or washing station (known as \u201cfactory\u201d in Kenya) and one specific physical prep. While single-factory lots certainly dominate the highest quality tier, coffee exports as a whole in Kenya reflect the distribution of most producing countries elsewhere: as a wide triangle, with microlots at the top and bulk volumes of various transparency and quality standards comprising the larger, more efficient shipments. Kenya, working the way it does, means the microlot segment is proportionally large compared to other origins. But it rests upon, and interacts with, a bulk market nonetheless.\nEach year Royal Coffee invests in select bulk lots with very specific physical and quality preparations, in addition to the microlot work. These coffees provide targeted profiles and roasting consistency over larger volumes and longer periods. There are myriad ways to build coffees like these, and considering the assertive attributes of Kenya\u2019s coffee as a whole, each one is naturally a little different.\nThis AA FAQ is a combination of processed coffee from select producing groups across Kenya\u2019s central counties. \u201cFAQ\u201d in Kenya stands for \u201cfair to average quality\u201d and is a cup quality designation rather than a physical grade. So, combined with the physical grade, (in this case \u201cAA\u201d for the country\u2019s larger screen sizes, 17-18) Kenya is able to offer interchangeable physical preparations and cup qualities from throughout the country.\nWithin this classification system, each exporter\u2019s quality team is responsible for selecting appropriate coffees that fit the system\u2019s expectations. But of course, no two final blends will be alike.\t\t",

Year after year Kirinyaga coffees are beloved for their ripe fruit-forward profiles, many reminiscent of berry jam, mandarin, and lemongrass.\nKenya\u2019s coffee is dominated by a cooperative system of production, whose members vote on representation, marketing and milling contracts for their coffee, as well as profit allocation. Baragwi Farmers Cooperative Society oversees the operations of all 12 member cooperatives with a combined total of 16,000 farmer members. The group, like many cooperative societies country-wide, has a farmer-elected board with members from each sublocation. Royal buys several single-grade lots (i.e. AA, AB, and Peaberry) from select cooperatives within the greater Baragwi group, but we also purchase single-grade lots from the cooperative society itself, which are created by blended and milling the output of multiple cooperatives together to the same high standards.\nHigh FOB prices for great Kenyas, while the norm, are not a panacea, and in Kenya in particular the number of individual margins sliced off an export price before payment reaches the actual farms is many, leaving only a small percentage to support coffee growth itself, and most often this arrives many months after harvest. However, Kenya coffees are sold competitively by quality, which means well-endowed counties like Kirinyaga achieve very high average prices year after year, and the smallholders here with a few hundred trees at the most, along with additional employment or land uses in the highlands, are widely considered to be middle class.\nKenya is of course known for some of the most meticulous at-scale processing that can be found anywhere in the world.

It is also practically brand new, having only formed in 2021. Mukaro is the result of a longtime effort by certain growers formerly affiliated with the Tetu Coffee Growers Cooperative. For years the growers sought start-up funds to acquire land for a central processing facility\u2014which in Kenya implies a wet mill, for producing fully-washed coffee\u2014all while delivering cherry to their local Tetu cooperatives. It wasn\u2019t until 2021, when the farmers received a critical training in natural processing, that they realized their dream of independence was closer than they thought. The farmers immediately set up cherry drying tables on their individual plots, and this is one of their first viable exports as a newly-formed society.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEast Africa\u2019s specialty coffee is largely defined by central processing systems and the efficiencies that they provide global markets. Mukaro Coffee Growers, however, thanks to their choice to process naturals, are doing things quite differently. Each of the 15 contributing growers sun-dries their cherry at home on their own farm, for 22-28 days, and then delivers their individual outturns to the local dry mill. At the mill, each farmer\u2019s coffee is cupped and evaluated separately from the others for quality and consistency. After being evaluated, individual coffees are bulked together to create final lots for milling and export. The average farm size of Mukaro\u2019s members is less than a single hectare; so, these are highly specific coffees made from extremely small contributors.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMukaro Coffee Growers is one of the smallest and newest grower societies to be part of the Kenya Cooperative Coffee Exporters (KCCE) organization. KCCE is an historic organization of almost 4,000 individual cooperatives. The group was formed in 2009, with the express goal of managing marketing and exporting operations cooperatively, as opposed to contractually with third parties. The\u202feconomics of smallholder systems\u202fare consistently difficult everywhere in the world, and in Kenya in particular the number of individual margins sliced off an export price before payment reaches the actual\u202ffarms is many, leaving only a small percentage to support coffee growth itself. And most often this arrives many months after harvest. KCCE, by managing more of the value chain itself, can capture a greater margin on behalf of the farms. Mukaro\u2019s natural, which, although small, represents a huge outlier to Kenya\u2019s status quo, is one example of farmer support and direct representation facilitated by KCCE.\u00a0\u00a0\t\t",

Conservation is creeping into the discussion in certain places--understandably in the drier areas where water, due to climate change, cannot be as taken for granted\u2014including at Murue FCS where 2 years ago all factories replaced their disc pulpers with \u201cecopulpers\u201d, models which use far less water to depulp and clean parchment.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAt Ngurueri, cherry is hand-sorted for ripeness and floated for density before accepted and depulped each day.\u00a0 Fermentation occurs overnight, after which the coffee is washed in long cement grading channels, where it is agitated with fresh water and allowed to separate by density, producing 4 final grades of clean parchment. The coffee is then dried over a period of 9-15 days on raised beds, which are carefully constructed to ensure proper air circulation and temperature control for optimal drying.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201c14CE0001\u201d in the title refers to this coffee\u2019s \u201coutturn\u201d number.

Outturns in Kenya are tracked with a shorthand code that places the specific batch of parchment coffee in time, place, and sequentially with other coffees. Outturns are stylized as an 8 or 9-character code, including a 2-digit \u201ccoffee week\u201d number, a 2-letter mill code, and a 3 or 4-digit intake number for the coffee\u2019s delivery.

However, Kenya coffees are sold competitively by quality, which means well-endowed counties like Nyeri achieve very high average prices year after year, and the smallholders here with a few hundred coffee trees at the most, plus additional land uses available and local job markets, are widely considered to be middle class.\n\nKenya is of course known for some of the most meticulous at-scale processing that can be found anywhere in the world.

Both rivers originate in the Aberdare mountain range, to Nyeri\u2019s west, whose cool air and precipitation is a contributor to Nyeri\u2019s coveted coffee terroir.\n\n\u201c20TY0004\u201d in the title refers to this coffee\u2019s \u201coutturn\u201d number. Outturn numbers are unique microlot codes that are given to each and every batch of parchment delivered to dry mills from individual factories or estates anywhere in Kenya, and are the units on which Kenya\u2019s entire microlot export system is built. Outturns in Kenya are tracked with a shorthand code that places the specific batch of parchment coffee in time, place, and sequentially with other coffees. Outturns are stylized as an 8 or 9-character code, including a 2-digit \u201ccoffee week\u201d number, a 2-letter mill code, and a 3 or 4-digit intake number for the coffee\u2019s delivery. So this particular lot was delivered in harvest week 20, to the Othaya\u2019s own dry mill (code \u201cTY\u201d), and was the 4th delivery that week.\n\nKenya is of course known for some of the most meticulous at-scale processing that can be found anywhere in the world. Bright white parchment, nearly perfectly sorted by density and bulk conditioned at high elevations is the norm, and a matter of pride, even for generations of Kenyan processing managers who prefer drinking Kenya\u2019s tea (abundantly farmed in nearby Muranga county) to its coffee. Ample water supply in the central growing regions has historically allowed factories to wash, and wash, and soak, and wash their coffees again entirely with fresh, cold river water. Conservation is creeping into the discussion in certain places--understandably in the drier areas where water, due to climate change, cannot be as taken for granted\u2014but for the most part Kenya continues to thoroughly wash and soak its coffees according to tradition. The established milling and sorting by grade, or bean size, is a longstanding tradition and positions Kenya coffees well for roasters, by tightly controlling the physical preparation and creating a diversity of profiles from a single processing batch.\t\t",

KCCE is an historic organization of almost 4,000 individual cooperatives. The group was formed in 2009, with the express goal of managing marketing and exporting operations internally and cooperatively, as opposed to contractually with third parties. The\u202feconomics of smallholder systems\u202fare consistently difficult everywhere in the world, and in Kenya in particular the number of individual margins sliced off an export price before payment reaches the actual\u202ffarms is many, leaving only a small percentage to support coffee growth itself. And most often this arrives many months after harvest. KCCE, by managing more of the value chain itself, can capture a greater margin on behalf of the farms. The chairman of Mahiga Factory, another Othaya FCS member, happens to also be one of the founding directors of KCCE\u2014so, the participation of Othaya FCS in farmer-forward infrastructure in Kenya is strong.\nKenya is of course known for some of the most meticulous at-scale processing that can be found anywhere in the world. Bright white parchment, nearly perfectly sorted by density and bulk conditioned at high elevations is the norm, and a matter of pride, even for generations of Kenyan processing managers who prefer drinking Kenya\u2019s tea (abundantly farmed in\u202fnearby\u202fMuranga\u202fcounty) to its coffee. Ample water supply in the central growing regions has historically allowed factories to wash, and wash, and soak, and wash their coffees again entirely with fresh, cold river water.\nGura typically ferments for 15 hours. After fermentation is complete, the decomposed mucilage is scrubbed away and the clean parchment soaks in a fresh water bath for another 16 hours. The parchment is then graded by density and sent to the drying tables, where it will stay for 2-3 weeks depending on the climate. After drying is complete the coffee is stored on site and eventually delivered to the Othaya dry mill for grading and a final density sort. The established milling and sorting by grade, or bean size, is a longstanding tradition and positions Kenya coffees well for roasters, by tightly controlling the physical preparation and creating a diversity of profiles from a single processing batch.\t\t",

To reach Kericho, on the other hand, requires a sweeping route along the eastern escarpment of the majestic Rift Valley, down across its lake-filled lowlands, and up the opposite slope. Tea is Kenya\u2019s most lucrative export by far, and Kericho county is a tea-producing powerhouse (\u201cKericho Gold\u201d is one of Kenya\u2019s national brands of bagged tea that is exported worldwide). The county sits just over the ridge from the enormous Lake Victoria, a source of near-constant humidity cycles for the region and an outlet for much of its local trade. In specialty coffee, this part of Kenya is lesser-known than the central counties. But producer groups here as just as old, experienced, and organized as Kenya\u2019s more famous regions.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Kabngetuny Farmers\u2019 Cooperative Society (FCS) was first established in 1985, and to this day has only one processing site. Kabngetuny is located in the Kipkelion district of Kericho county surrounded by the scenic beauty of the Nandi hills and Mau Natural Reserve, at the admirable elevation of 2000 meters, higher than many central Kenya organizations are found. The society has 900 total members, 300 of which are women, and with a combined production of 281 hectares\u2014less than 1/3 of a hectare of coffee per farmer on average\u2014most of whom produce some combination of corn, beans, squash, and banana in addition to coffee.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nKenya is of course known for some of the most meticulous at-scale processing that can be found anywhere in the world. Bright white parchment, nearly perfectly sorted by density and bulk conditioned at high elevations is the norm, and a matter of pride, even for generations of Kenyan processing managers who prefer drinking Kenya\u2019s tea (especially in Kericho) to its coffee. The established milling and sorting by grade, or bean size, is a longstanding tradition and positions Kenya coffees well for roasters, by tightly controlling the physical preparation and creating a diversity of profiles from a single processing batch. Kabngetuny depulps and ferments their coffee the same day they are picked and delivered by members, then ferments overnight, washes the parchment clean, and dries slowly over 2-3 weeks on raised beds.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c18KE2020\u201d in the title refers to this coffee\u2019s \u201coutturn\u201d number. Outturn numbers are unique microlot codes that are given to each and every batch of parchment delivered to dry mills from individual factories or estates anywhere in Kenya, and are the units on which Kenya\u2019s entire microlot export system is built. Outturns in Kenya are tracked with a shorthand code that places the specific batch of parchment coffee in time, place, and sequentially with other coffees. Outturns are stylized as an 8 or 9-character code, including a 2-digit \u201ccoffee week\u201d number, a 2-letter mill code, and a 3 or 4-digit intake number for the coffee\u2019s delivery. This particular code accompanies the lot throughout the entire journey from factory to export to ensure full traceability.\u00a0\t\t",

This is the Oaxacan coffee growing region where the Sierra Madre del Sur coastal mountain range is peppered with small family farms, each consisting of just a few acres of land. Nearly forty percent of the producers are women who rely on coffee income to support their families. Producers here continue to identify with their indigenous roots using organic practices to manage their farms and protect their environment. They harvest cherries, then depulp, ferment, wash, and dry the coffee using their own micro-mills. While these producers are their own architects, designing farm management and post-harvest solutions to fit their needs, they need strong alliances to bring their coffee to the international market and earn fair prices. In Oaxaca, more than 4,000 producers from 134 communities and 45 producer associations have consolidated their efforts into an umbrella cooperative called Coordinadora Estatal de Productores de Caf\u00e9 del Estado de Oaxaca (CEPCO), which carries out activities that are often overlooked but crucial to small producers. For example, CEPCO has helped producers gain access to credit and certifications. CEPCO has also led the leaf rust recovery effort, helping thousands of producers renovate their farms and increase their production of organic fertilizers. Investments for basic infrastructure needs, like road improvements, establishing local warehouses, and dry-mill facilities are also coordinated through CEPCO.

And these delicate genetics clearly thrive in PNG\u2019s highlands, which are some of the most virgin and fertile on the planet.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBetween World Wars I and II, Australian settlers would establish more and more large coffee estates across the Eastern, Chimbu, Jiwaka, and Western highland provinces. As commercial exports ramped up, more indigenous Papuans would adopt coffee as a cash crop alongside their traditional economies, in most cases processing at home and selling humid parchment to traveling collectors. For hundreds of thousands of rural farmers coffee would be, and still is, the very first and only source of western currency. To this day expert-level cultivation knowledge largely remains in the possession and experience of PNG\u2019s plantation owners. Remote smallholder coffee tends to fall short of its potential, receiving only scarce quality interventions from ambitious millers and exporters.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThis unique natural lot is made possible by New Guinea Highlands (NGH), a miller and exporter based in Garoka, one of the main coffee industry hubs in PNG\u2019s highlands. NGH also partners with independent washing stations and occasionally commissions specific processing styles in collaboration with participating growers. In this case, NGH worked with processors in the Aviamp area that straddles the border between Jiwaka and the Western Highlands. Cherry delivered daily by surrounding smallholders is depulped and fermented for an average of 48 hours, and then sun-dried. Daily batches of finished parchment are moved to a local dry mill for moisture conditioning and milling, after which the finished green coffee is transported to NGH\u2019s headquarters in Garoka for quality analysis and blending.\u00a0\t\t",

And these delicate genetics clearly thrive in PNG\u2019s highlands, which are some of the most virgin and fertile on the planet.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBetween World Wars I and II, Australian settlers would establish more and more large coffee estates across the Eastern, Chimbu, Jiwaka, and Western highland provinces. As commercial exports ramped up, more indigenous Papuans would adopt coffee as a cash crop alongside their traditional economies, in most cases processing at home and selling humid parchment to traveling collectors. For hundreds of thousands of rural farmers coffee would be, and still is, the very first and only source of western currency. To this day expert-level cultivation knowledge largely remains in the possession and experience of PNG\u2019s plantation owners. Remote smallholder coffee tends to fall short of its potential, receiving only scarce quality interventions from ambitious millers and exporters.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThis unique natural lot is made possible by New Guinea Highlands (NGH), a miller and exporter based in Garoka, one of the main coffee industry hubs in PNG\u2019s highlands. NGH also partners with independent washing stations and occasionally commissions specific processing styles in collaboration with participating growers. In this case, NGH worked with processors in the Aviamp area that straddles the border between Jiwaka and the Western Highlands. Cherry delivered daily by surrounding smallholders is depulped and fermented for an average of 48 hours, and then sun-dried. Daily batches of finished parchment are moved to a local dry mill for moisture conditioning and milling, after which the finished green coffee is transported to NGH\u2019s headquarters in Garoka for quality analysis and blending.\u00a0\t\t",

        "background": "\n\t\t\tCoffee Background\n\t\t\tDukunde Kawa is a well-known producer group in Rwanda, as much for exceptionally bright and memorable coffees as for its exceptional business structure: the cooperative carries multiple certifications for its various washing stations including Fair Trade, Organic, Rainforest Alliance, and UTZ, and more than 80% of its workforce is women. Not only that but the organization is located in the Northern province, which, despite its closeness to Kigali, tends to be little-known in specialty coffee compared to the west and south. Since first organizing in 2000 with a single wet mill, years before the majority of washing stations in Rwanda even existed, Dukunde Kawa has received sustainability awards from the SCA as well as placing in the top positions in Rwanda\u2019s Cup of Excellence competition. Today the cooperative has over 2,000 farmer members and multiple washing stations in the Gakenke District north of Kigali. Nkara is one of these stations.\nNkara was established by Dukunde Kawa in 2007 to give farmers in this area a shorter commute to deliver cherry during harvest (Ruli, the coop\u2019s other nearest station, made for a long journey for many and the quality of cherry suffered as a result). This is one of the highest elevations that Dukunde Kawa serves, with farms passing 2100 meters. Nkara itself sits at 1800 meters. Because of the high elevation and local climate, harvest here progresses slowly and members annually pick coffee into the month of October, multiple months past the majority of the country. Processing at Nkara includes cherry sorting by the farmers themselves upon delivery, and then floated in a large receiving bay to identify and remove floaters (low-density cherry which is processed separately). Cherry is then depulped and the fresh parchment is graded immediately by flotation in a short channel. Fermentation usually lasts 18 hours and is completed without water. Once the dry fermentation is complete the parchment is soaked in fresh water between 18-24 hours to halt fermentation and the stabilize moisture content of the batch. After the soak the parchment is washed once again, this time in grading channels\u2014long shallow concrete channels with water flowing through\u2014which allows the parchment to naturally separate by density. From here, each separate density grade is moved to pre-drying tables to be hand-sorted for imperfections and gently dried to the touch. After the hand-sort is complete, the parchment is then moved to fully-exposed drying tables to finish drying, a process that takes between 14-21 days depending on the climate.\nDespite its diminutive size compared to other East Africa coffee producing countries, Rwanda\u2019s coffee has an important history and terroir entirely unique to the rest of the continent. Coffee was originally forced upon remote communities by the Belgians as a colony-funding cash crop. The Belgians distributed varieties cultivated by the French on Ile de Bourbon (now Reunion Island, near Madagascar) but had so little invested in coffee\u2019s success that they immediately allowed production to decline through lack of investment in national infrastructure, as well as the farmers who grew it. As a result, the sector suffered near total obscurity in the coffee world from Rwanda\u2019s independence in 1962 until the period of rebuilding following the country\u2019s devastating civil war and astonishingly tragic genocide in 1994.\nRwanda\u2019s former cash crop, however, roared to international buyer attention in the late 2000\u2019s thanks to one of East Africa\u2019s most successful coffee interventions, the Partnership for Enhancing Agriculture in Rwanda Through Linkages (PEARL). PEARL was a sweeping infrastructure and education investment targeting large regions of Rwanda whose coffee was for the most part processed poorly at home and exported with little traceability. The program, designed and led by the University of Michigan, Texas A&M and a host of Rwandan organizations, vastly increased processing hygiene by building washing stations. It also organized remote and under-resourced smallholders into cooperative businesses capable of specialty partnerships. Perhaps most significantly for the long term, it took the legacy bourbon genetics buried in abandon and polished them anew to the amazement of coffee drinkers everywhere. The snappy acidity, stone fruit flavors, and fragrant herbaceousness found in Rwanda\u2019s coffee is still completely unique to bourbon produced anywhere else in the entire world. Producer groups like Dukunde Kawa cherish their farmers\u2019 potential and are learning to maximize the quality and variety available from Rwanda\u2019s most promising terroirs.\t\t",

Huye\u2019s main city, known as both Huye and Butare, is Rwanda\u2019s third largest city and home to the University of Rwanda campus. It is a bustling, well-educated city surrounded by talented coffee producers. A winning combination for specialty development. Huye is much dryer than the nearby Nyamasheke district, whose position between the mighty Nyungwe National Forest and the miraculous Lake Kivu leaves it naturally endowed for fully washed processing. However, Huye receives strong, reliable rains and the coffee potential has always been high. A few talented producer groups here managed to put Huye on the map in the late aughts with some of the first traceable and collaborative relationship coffees the U.S. specialty industry had seen.\nHorizon is a Huye-area washing station, recently purchased in 2018 from previous operators who had left it in poor shape. The new name, Horizon, was chosen to represent a vision of long-term quality and optimism. The management team had ample combined experience from running processing stations in the western province, and immediately set about restoring machinery and re-designing quality assurance protocols. The result, in just a few harvests, has been consistently bright, aromatic and honey-sweet coffee. This past season Horizon produced 2 containers of coffee.\nCoffee at Horizon is hand-picked by participating smallholder farmers and carefully inspected upon delivery to the washing station. After depulping in a vintage disk pulper, coffee is fermented underwater, washed clean with fresh water, and then dried on raised beds for 10-14 days.\nHorizon works with Rwanda Trading Company (RTC), a miller and exporter that began in 2010 managing small shipments of coffee from Kigali and has since grown into one of the best end-to-end value chain operators in the country. RTC works with dozens of washing stations across the country, not only milling and marketing their finished coffee, but also pre-financing harvests, providing farm management curriculums to local teams, helping processors establish their cherry prices, and centralizing quality control, allowing them to break down or combine deliveries to maximize returns to washing stations and coops. The title of this coffee, \u201cInzovu Supreme\u201d, is RTC\u2019s label for full-container-load, top quality lots that they market each year. In this case, the coffee is from a single washing station; but other Inzovu Supreme lots can be multi-station blends depending on profile.\t\t",

The cool, humid climates of both Lake Kivu and the Nyungwe Forest National Park keep groundwater abundant throughout the uniquely hilly region.

Coffees from this region are often jammier and heavier than in the rest of the country. Murundo\u2019s coffees in particular are full of complex sugars, currant-like acids, blackberry and spice flavors, and round, soft textures.\nKivubelt was established in 2011 by Furaha Umwizey, after returning to Rwanda with a master\u2019s degree in economics from Switzerland. Born and raised in Rwanda, Umwizey\u2019s goal with Kivubelt is to create a model coffee plantation, as sustainable in agriculture as it is impactful in local employment and empowerment.

Kivubelt has also acquired two washing stations, Murundo and Jarama, which combined not only process coffee from the company\u2019s estates, but also that of more than 500 smallholders in the region, offering quality premiums and training programs for participating farming families. Because coffee is often the only source of family income, the price premiums provided by Kivubelt have in many cases made possible things like house repairs, school fees, the purchasing of livestock, and the expansion of the farmland itself. In addition to farmer benefits, Murundo employs up to 600 local staff during harvest time to manage processing, operations, storage, and security, which makes them one of the largest job providers in the area.\nProcessing at Murundo works like many top-quality central processing sites in Nyamasheke: cherry is grown and harvested by individual family farms and brought to the processing site for inspection. Depulping is done with a McKinnon disc pulper, a large, long piece of equipment that uses flotation channels immediately after depulping to separate parchment coffee by density and is used commonly in central Kenya. Depulped and fermented parchment is cleaned and then immediately hand-sorted on the drying tables for visible imperfections. The parchment is continuously rotated throughout the drying process, before being transferred to an aerated warehouse for storage and conditioning.\nCoffee estates like Kivubelt\u2019s are rare in Rwanda, where coffee was originally forced upon remote communities by the Belgians as a colony-funding cash crop. The Belgians distributed varieties cultivated by the French on Ile de Bourbon (now Reunion Island, near Madagascar) but had so little invested in coffee\u2019s success that they immediately allowed it to decline through lack of investment in both infrastructure and the farmers who grew it.

Its highland territory, surrounding Lake\u00a0Tawar\u00a0and the central city of\u00a0Takengon, is considered to be the epicenter of one of the world\u2019s most unique coffee terroirs. Coffee farms in this area are managed with the experience of many generations of cultivation, while also harmoniously woven into their surrounding tropical forests. The canopies are loud and fields are almost impenetrably thick with coffee plants, fruit trees, and vegetables, all of which are constantly flushing with new growth. Year-round mists and rain showers never cease, farm floors are spongy and deep with layered biomass, and almost every square meter of the region seems to exude life. Nothing is ever still. Including coffee ripening, which occurs ten months out of the year.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nGayoMandiri\u00a0is\u00a0a\u00a0family-operated\u00a0exporter\u00a0based in\u00a0Bener\u00a0Meriah, a\u00a0broad\u00a0district\u00a0that\u00a0encompasses the\u00a0mountains along the north shore of Lake\u00a0Tawar.\u00a0Gayo\u00a0Mandiri\u00a0works with local cooperatives, operates a central dry mill, and promotes a relationship-based sales model with their buyers.\u00a0Royal has been purchasing coffee from\u00a0Gayo\u00a0Mandiri\u00a0since 2013.\u00a0\n\nSumatra\u2019s smallholder coffee is a complicated process. Notably, processing is typically not overseen by a single individual or team; instead, coffee moves task by task through different parties before reaching its final, fully-dried, state.\u00a0Coffee farms in\u00a0Bener\u00a0Meriah\u00a0average\u00a00.5-2\u00a0hectares\u00a0each. Every\u00a0village\u00a0with cooperative members\u00a0has a collector (or more)\u00a0who receives\u00a0fresh-picked\u00a0cherry\u00a0for\u00a0washed\u00a0processing each day.\u00a0Once\u00a0a batch of\u00a0coffee has been\u00a0depulped, fermented overnight, washed clean, and then\u00a0sun-dried to the touch, each collector then\u00a0delivers the batch to the cooperative\u2019s central mill.\u00a0It is\u00a0at the mill\u00a0where\u00a0the\u00a0coffee is\u00a0mechanically\u00a0hulled of its parchment, leaving\u00a0behind\u00a0just the\u00a0soft, high-moisture coffee bean (thus earning the term \u201cwet-hulled\u201d), all of which is\u00a0spread out on large patios to continue drying.\u00a0Each handoff is orchestrated by the cooperative, and the members\u2019 coffee is traced throughout each step of the chain.\u00a0\n\nCV\u00a0Gayo\u00a0Mandiri, along with many local industries in the region, identifies itself as \u201cGayo\u201d, after the\u00a0Gayonese\u00a0ethnic group which has long made Aceh their home, and which comprises a vast majority of farmer members. Regional coffee distinctions in the northern provinces of Sumatra are interestingly all based on human ethnicity, rather than geography itself, which unfortunately has muddled the island\u2019s traceability over time. \u201cMandheling\u201d for example, is a broad label for a widespread cultural group in Sumatra and Malaysia and subsequently the broadest coffee trading term, applying to almost any chosen blend of wet-hulled coffees from across the northern half of the island. These terms are malleable, and it is often difficult to pinpoint a coffee\u2019s exact origin without direct partnerships that allow buyers to trace the entire value chain themselves.\u00a0So,\u00a0it is\u00a0helpful\u00a0to work with exporters with a local supply chain, who themselves operate in the highlands and are personally invested in their community\u2019s success.\u00a0Gayo\u00a0Mandiri\u00a0regularly distributes farming tools\u00a0and cash dividends to cooperative members, as well as invests in drying tents for their central operations to reduce the risk of coffee spoilage.\u00a0\u00a0\t\t",

Mill innovations have also vastly improved water management and quality control from picking to export. More than 50 full time employees have access to housing and land to grow food crops for their families.\t\t",

To ensure improved post-harvest processing, Soochak Bush and Tropex have rehabilitated 8 existing wet mills, built 13 new centralized wet mills, and another 8 micro-wet mills. Cherries are hand sorted, soaked so floaters can be removed, depulped, fermented for 2 to 3 days, washed in channels, dried on raised beds, and then sorted again at the dry mill.

        "background": "\n\t\t\tCoffee Background\n\t\t\tMount Elgon is a massive peak split nearly in two by the border of Uganda and Kenya. The \u201cmountain\u201d itself, now an extinct shield volcano, is more an enormous expanse of successive plateaus that float dramatically above the surrounding valley floor. It is also home to a dense patchwork of farming communities growing some of the best organic coffee in Africa.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nMountain Harvest is a very young and big-thinking group, first established in 2017. The company is dedicated to long-term economic and environmental sustainability for smallholders on Mt. Elgon. These farmers are Uganda\u2019s highest and most diversified coffee growers with incredible quality potential thanks to the climate, soil fertility, and a longstanding culture of land stewardship, but who historically struggle to meet specialty standards by processing coffee in tiny amounts on homemade equipment.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0In an effort to raise the economic standard in remote coffee-growing Elgon communities, Mountain Harvest began as an impact investing project underwritten by Lutheran World Relief (LWR). It has expanded in just a few years to include farmer education and training, central processing infrastructure, storage facilities throughout the region, detailed quality control, and international marketing. As of this year Mountain Harvest works with 850 individual smallholders across 8 communities on Mt. Elgon, with each farm growing between 600-1,000 coffee trees. And their coffee stands up to the best fully washed Uganda arabicas we typically taste all year.\u00a0\n\nThe vast majority of coffee managed by Mountain Harvest is traditionally processed by farmers at home and delivered as parchment. This coffee, however, is a centrally-processed, fully washed microlot from select communities within Mountain Harvest\u2019s farmer network: fresh picked cherry was transported directly from select farms in sealed drums to an experimental processing site constructed by Mountain Harvest near their headquarters in Mbale, where it was depulped, fermented for 24 hours, and dried in larger, carefully-controlled volume on raised beds, all of which is overseen by Mountain Harvest\u2019s processing manager, Ibra Kiganda. Centralized processing is ubiquitous across East Africa but in Uganda it is still rare, where collecting low-quality, often still humid, parchment from smallholders is the norm. While Mountain Harvest has had great success training their farmer base to home-process to excellent standards, the central-processing microlots are an attempt to elevate cup profiles even more through greater control.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOver the course of a full harvest coffees are built into blended containers, single-community lots, experimental centrally-processed lots like this one, and single-delivery microlots for sale. Mountain Harvest\u2019s minimum pricing is 10-30% above local market prices. Unlike other regional buyers who exclusively process centrally or buy lower grade smallholder parchment, Mountain Harvest invests in farmers\u2019 capacity to produce high-specialty cherry or fully-dried parchment coffee within their own resources, helping them maximize their margin when they sell.\u00a0\t\t",

The \u201cmountain\u201d itself, now an extinct shield volcano, is more an enormous expanse of successive plateaus that float dramatically above the surrounding valley floor. It is also home to a dense patchwork of farming communities growing some of the best organic coffee in Africa.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nMountain Harvest is a very young and big-thinking group, first established in 2017. The company is dedicated to long-term economic and environmental sustainability for smallholders on Mt. Elgon. These farmers are Uganda\u2019s highest and most diversified coffee growers with incredible quality potential thanks to the climate, soil fertility, and a longstanding culture of land stewardship, but who historically struggle to meet specialty standards by processing coffee in tiny amounts on homemade equipment.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0In an effort to raise the economic standard in remote coffee-growing Elgon communities, Mountain Harvest began as an impact investing project underwritten by Lutheran World Relief (LWR). It has expanded in just a few years to include farmer education and training, central processing infrastructure, storage facilities throughout the region, detailed quality control, and international marketing. As of this year Mountain Harvest works with 850 individual smallholders across 8 communities on Mt. Elgon, with each farm growing between 600-1,000 coffee trees. And their coffee stands up to the best fully washed Uganda arabicas we typically taste all year.\u00a0\n\nThe vast majority of coffee managed by Mountain Harvest is traditionally processed by farmers at home and delivered as parchment. This coffee, however, is a centrally-processed, fully washed microlot from select communities within Mountain Harvest\u2019s farmer network: fresh picked cherry was transported directly from select farms in sealed drums to an experimental processing site constructed by Mountain Harvest near their headquarters in Mbale, where it was depulped, fermented for 24 hours, and dried in larger, carefully-controlled volume on raised beds, all of which is overseen by Mountain Harvest\u2019s processing manager, Ibra Kiganda. Centralized processing is ubiquitous across East Africa but in Uganda it is still rare, where collecting low-quality, often still humid, parchment from smallholders is the norm. While Mountain Harvest has had great success training their farmer base to home-process to excellent standards, the central-processing microlots are an attempt to elevate cup profiles even more through greater control.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOver the course of a full harvest coffees are built into blended containers, single-community lots, experimental centrally-processed lots like this one, and single-delivery microlots for sale. Mountain Harvest\u2019s minimum pricing is 10-30% above local market prices. Unlike other regional buyers who exclusively process centrally or buy lower grade smallholder parchment, Mountain Harvest invests in farmers\u2019 capacity to produce high-specialty cherry or fully-dried parchment coffee within their own resources, helping them maximize their margin when they sell.\u00a0\t\t",

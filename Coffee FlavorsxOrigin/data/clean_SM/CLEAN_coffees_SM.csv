It's always such a stunning cup, one of the more uniquely fruited and clean wet process coffees.

So they are blended with other top scoring lots and sold under the ""Las Estrellas"" moniker. Imagine our surprise at seeing her 2 bag submission, the perfect size for a microlot feature!

Pouring hot water brings up a dark sweetness of cooked brown sugars, nicely caramelized, with some fruit behind it, like fig bar filling, and a little fresh fruit when running my spoon through the crust. My coffee descriptors are often colored by some of the more common foods and flavors we're lucky enough to taste on our origin trips. There's certainly nothing wrong with that (though perhaps not always the most universal, or accessible to all of our customers). In the case of Anibal's coffee, the sweetness in the hot cup truly has a flavor of fresh pressed sugar cane juice, a refreshing beverage in Colombia due to the abundance of sugar cane fields. It has a potent, and near floral sweetness that's quite intense! The coffee quickly shows it's fruited side as well, with notes of white peach, apricot, red apple, and more.

The dry fragrance has sweet notes of caramel and honey, a hint of creamy chocolate (I wrote ""Oreo"", actually), and dried apricot. The wet aroma produces low-intensity berry accents in the steam, with nice, clean dark chocolate bittersweet notes. In the brew, I'm struck by the level of acidity in light City roasts.

If you've never tried rue, it's commonly steeped in coffee in Ethiopia, and gives the cup an intoxicating aroma that falls somewhere lemon verbena and sweet basil. We've picked up on it in other Ethiopian coffees too, but Tom noted that it tastes like the coffee was literally brewed with it! I'm not so sure everyone will identify something they haven't tasted before, but pinpointing the herbal essence is likely. The smells are more straight-forward 'natural' in that they revolve around a mixture of fruit and berries, especially in the wet aroma. City roasts raise a satisfying blend of boysenberry, tamarind, and tropical notes of papaya and mango in the steam. The brewed coffee is complex, with bright fruit flavors, that have a remarkable intensity to them. The flavor profile starts out with notes of blackberry that have a wine-like quality, pomegranate syrup, and a balsamic hint. There's also a honey-sweet flavor that comes up as the coffee cools, that along with the wine note, gives off a subtle impression of honey mead.  The 'rue' note has a strong impact on aroma, and holds equal footing with the big fruit flavors in the lighter roasts. It's a really enjoyable cup, and certainly unique! My Full City roast didn't fair quite as well in the cup, and produced a bittering roast flavor that was incongruous with the fruit flavors underneath in my opinion, as there wasn't the supporting acidity to help prop them up. I found a little more success with that roast as espresso, though I still found the fruit to be a little limp.

Keramo excels as a light roasted coffee and any darker than City+ risks compromising this flavorful brew by introducing rustic roast tones that add an earth-y hue to the coffee. Two things worth noting: One, there are some very small beans in this coffee. If you're roasting with a Behmor, I recommend giving the drum a shake before loading in order to let those smallest beans shake free which will keep them from smoldering in the bottom of the roast chamber.

It makes roasting a little trickier, but well worth the challenge! (see Farm Notes for some roasting guidance).

My Full City+ roasts had an incredibly dense body and mouthfeel, and with a unique bitter spice flavor note that comes through a lot like clove spice in the finish. It adds quite a bit of interest to the cup profile, and not a flavor I've tasted in Robusta before! Robusta can be quite shocking on its own, but dark roasts are well suited for milk drinks, espresso, and of course using in blends. I tried my 2nd Crack roast with a splash of milk, and the punchy bittering qualities are quite nice in that context. For blending, a little bit goes a long way, so try 1:4 ratio to washed and/or natural Arabicas, and go from there.

The cup sweetness walks a tightrope between unrefined sweeteners and earthy dried date. I'm giving City roasting the green light here - not often recommended for wet hulled coffees - which cultivates a moderately bright cup considering, with acidity being informed by notes of lemony sour grass, and a hint of orange herbal bitters.

In our City roast, we noted smells of red fruit punch, fruit leathers, and complex fragrance of spiced loose leaf teas. The sweetness unfolds to something even more intense in the wet aroma, blossoming with raw sugar-backed fruit smells that range from berry types to stone fruit. The cup displays brilliant acidity at a range of roasts, though definitely brightest at the light end of the roast spectrum. It's not overly acidic and citric per se, but like a watered down blackberry juice, or black currant tea, brisk and mouth refreshing. Brightness is at a moderate level for Kenya, and strings together a wide swath of flavor hints like pomegranate, dark sugars, fresh fig, and some chai spice tea. Brewing a slightly darker roast brought out more of a dark berry flavor tone that resonates in the cup, and chocolate covered coconut flavor holds in in the long aftertaste. In my opinion City and City+ roasts is where complexity really shines, yielding a light and bright cup with complex top notes, with underlying sweetness which does well to prop up the cup profile. But Full City is still deliciously fruited, but much more bittersweet at its core. Being an AA outturn, the beans are large, and in this case mean a little deceiving to judge the lightest roasts.

The acidity is quite bright, a detail that's underscored by citrus notes of orange juice, and pink lemonade. Spiced notes cap things off nicely and culminate in a flavor profile of spiced tea (Good Earth if you've tried it). There's this vanilla aromatic note that marks the aroma too, that together with the citrus brings out a flavor profile of an Orange Julius drink!

When the cup is hot, it showcases a much brighter citrus side than I was expecting. Flavors are vibrant and tart, with notes of orange, sweetened lemonade, and grabby grapefruit. Even at Full City, I'm getting this really tangy lemon note amidst the smokier roast bittering. The flavor combo reminds me of espresso with a lemon rind.

That's not a good or bad thing, really, but a fact worth pointing out since traditional processed Sumatras can be quite polarizing to coffee drinkers due to their characteristic earthy flavor profile (though we love them!). The dry grounds show molasses and caramel sweetness that leads into creamy custard, with soft herbal hints in the back end. The wet aroma is permeated with toasted sugar sweetness that resonates in the steam, along with torched sugar notes like a flambe'd dessert. Ribang Gayo boasts moderate acidity relative to the origin, with a note of apple amidst toasted sugar overtones. The cooling cup yields flavors of baked goods, with something like butternut squash cooked with brown sugar, and impacts the aftertaste too. Full City roasts develop a delectible low tones, the roast bittering bringing up an assemblage of chocolate flavors in the middle and finish. There was also an herbal note in my darker roast that brought to mind sage-infused chocolate. Delicious! I pulled two really nice shots with my Full City roast after 5 days of rest. My grind was a touch too coarse my first go, but still produced a nice flavor profile of chocolate-almond. A slight adjustment to my grinder, and I landed on a very nice flow rate for a short ristretto shot, which proved to be a tad brighter than the first one, and the chocolate/almond flavors were much more distilled down into the cream-textured liquid.

(After all, it is a blend of Ethiopian coffees!) I try not to judge espresso by how it looks, but I felt fairly certain this year's version was bound to be a knockout before taking my first sip. Watching the velvety textured liquor fold into itself when pulling a shot, I found myself transfixed by the visual parallels to pouring chocolate syrup! For espresso, I'm sticking with Full City to Full City+ roast levels as the recommended range for this blend, the outer edge allowing for just a few 2nd snaps. Anything lighter than this and you wind up with shockingly bright acidity. This might suit some, but I found it to be far too puckering. Right around Full City (around 30F post 1st C) is where I find a nice mixture of bittersweetness and fruit paired in the shot, berry and softer stone fruit notes, and some tangy fruit flavors as well. This blend makes an incredibly creamy-textured shot, with a thick layer of brown-speckled, golden crema crowning the liquid. But flavor's what's important, and 2.0 is so different than any other blend we have. Chocolate bittersweets are central to the profile, though the fruited cup flavors nearly find equal footing at Full City. Delicious dark fruit notes are jammy and sweet, rolled into robust bittersweet flavors that don't let up in the long finish. Stepping out a little farther on the flavor branch, I pick up on notes of blackberry, dark chocolates filled fruited liqueurs, and black plum, all woven into a complex foil of dark chocolate notes like Scharffen Berger bar, and creamy bittersweet ganache. Full City+ (FC+) flattens out the acidity, but berry notes still manage to leave an impression amidst bittering, smokey roast tones that bring out more of a roasted nib bittering quality.

The more developed roast presented a lot darker in both flavor and color, and had a more pungent flavor profile that hinted at burned sugars and dark syrupy molasses without pulling out any off or ashy flavors. The coffee lets off an interesting fragrance and aromatic profile for decaf, from blackstrap molasses, to honeydew sweetness, to black pepper spiced notes, and an earthy sweet low tone that offers a 'nod' to the Indonesian blend components.  City+ roasts make an amazing cup, and I honestly wouldn't know it's decaf if no one told me! There is chocolate bittersweetness meshed with hints of cooked fruit, cinnamon-laced sugar, and a savory hint of browned butter. It's not a bright cup, but not flat either, a welcome aspect in a decaf. The fruit accents at this lighter end of the spectrum give the cup a mild acidic impression. Body is substantial at Full City, so a very successful Moka Java blend in that respect.

Dense, thick body adds to the sense of an almost chewy cup character! Full City+ roasts show a bittersweetness of smoky cacao nib and mesquite notes, offset by sweet molasses and chocolate syrup, that all do well to ground the wilder cup characteristics. Espresso is where this blend really shows best, with an underpinning of rich chocolate layers, high % cacao up front, roasted nibs in the middle, and an unsweetened baking type chocolate flavor that lingers long into the finish. Dried fruit notes are played up in the cup, due in large part to the Ethiopian component that finds footing in the flavor profile. Notes of slab apricot and plum offer fruited counterpoints to the bold, bittersweet low tones, and are distilled down to an opaque fruited chocolate flavor.

The Central American base component lays the groundwork for a chocolate-centric profile, while a pair of washed Ethiopian accent ingredients bring out a sparkling bright spot and aromatic highlights too. Full City to be the optimal starting point for espresso extraction, though I imagine some will enjoy the brighter shots at City+ (like me!). But vibrance is not completely sacrificed at Full City roast level, where the tart 'zing' of lemony acidity, and other fruited top notes are tempered by syrupy bittersweetness. IMO, this year's blend is extremely 'milk drinks' friendly, but with more than a touch of complexity that makes it stand way out when enjoyed 'solo'. The shots pull beautifully, producing a thick, velvety cap to the liquor, which is no real indicator of quality but certainly looks attractive! Putting my nose to the cup, the aroma is filled with bittersweet chocolate laced with torched sugars, and the fruit and red berry notes making a much more subtle impact on the profile. The perceived acidity is moderated by how you pull your shot almost as much as roast level. My ristretto shots of a Full City roast (400 F 1st crack / 430 F finish) had a sharp lemon juice note up front that quickly gave way to bittersweet flavors of dark chocolate syrup and roasted cacao confections. This silky espresso weighs heavily on your palate, further implying ""chocolate"" in the overall flavor construct, and letting it sit in your mouth gives you time to peel back complex layers like dark chocolate ganache, cocoa-dusted truffle, bittering roasted cacao nibs, and more. Longer pulls see the fruits coming off more berry like - tart raspberry, and cranberry - but the spotlight is still reserved for silky, bittersweet chocolate flavors. My darkest roast hit 2nd snaps in the cooling tray (400F 1st crack / 442 finish) and though maybe a touch too dark for my taste, the level of sweetness is impressive, as are dark chocolate low tones, accented by a note of blackberry reduction.

While it no doubt presents a rustic sweetness, it's relatively clean for the origin, intensely bittersweet, with some woodsy spice and other top notes that construct a complex flavor profile. I really liked this coffee when it was offered to us earlier in the year, and having recently participated in the Best of Yemen competition, I've particularly enjoyed taking this 'second look'. We tasted a lot of really wild processing techniques in the Yemeni competition that had a huge impact on cup flavors. Sometimes that worked out well, and other times, well, not so much. This may be a dry processed coffee, but Hawari doesn't suffer from the funky fruit that comes with over fermentation. I pick up on a lot of caramel sweetness in medium roasts, like buttery caramel in smells, and more toasted/caramelized sugars in flavor. I think this might be lower intensity in terms of fruit than some of the other Yemens we've had, but I do sense dried fruit accents underneath the sweetness, though fairly faint in comparison to the bittersweet bass flavors.

The aroma is complex (no surprise, with layers of coconut palm sugar, chocolate raisin, cooked squash, cocoa and allusions to natural dehydrated fruits when breaking through the crust. Harasi should be roasted to City+ minimum, but I really think Full City is a good starting point. Middle roast levels build out a bittersweet chocolate core that expands to include creamy Brazil nut and raw cacao, leaving room for top notes of fruit and rustic leathery notes that add to the cup intensity. The cooling coffee produces flavor aspects of dried fig, pepitas, chocolate malted grains, and a brown ale note in the aftertaste (I wrote ""Newcastle"", but I don't think it's that specific!). There is a cooked pumpkin flavor too that points to pie filling, with earthy rhubarb, cola, and some palo santo incense. My darkest Full City+ roast pushed bittersweet cocoa roast tones to their limit, with wisps of sweet smoke, black licorice, and aromatic apple wood smoke. This viscous coffee also makes an intense shot of espresso on its own, as well as a bittersweet/body ingredient for espresso blending.

While this coffee is rustic for sure, it's in a much cleaner camp relative to Yemeni coffee (at least in my experience). The coffee reveals a delicious fruited side, with glimpses of natural dried apricot, cooked berry reductions, and baked apple (even a bit on the 'tart' side of apple skin). The chocolate flavors are well defined, offset by molasses type sweetness, and aromatic hint of chai spice. Roasting to Full City, a dried fig hint quickly gives way to rustic cocoa powder bittering, and a pipe tobacco accent leaves a lasting impression in the finish.
